As used in these Rules and Regulations the following terms shall have the following meanings:

Department. "Department" means the department of records and information services.

Agencies which presently maintain records of a type destroyed pursuant to such directions may request permission to dispose of any such records which have since become eligible for disposal. Eligibility for disposal shall be determined by reference to the schedules used by the Board of Estimate in issuing such directions. Requests to dispose of records pursuant to an interim disposal schedule will be made pursuant to 49 RCNY § 1-05.






*§ 1-04 Procedure for Making Requests to Establish a Records Disposal Schedule.* ::


(a) Agency requests for the establishment of a records disposal schedule shall be made to the Department on such forms as may be prescribed by the Department.

Based on the findings for such survey, a records disposal schedule shall be established by the Department and approved by the corporation counsel and the Office of the Comptroller. Each agency shall provide the Department, the corporation counsel and the comptroller with its full cooperation and shall provide any information necessary to evaluate the request. If the Department or the corporation counsel deems it necessary, the agency shall provide access to the records in question and, if requested, shall forward such records to the Department or corporation counsel for examination.

(c) The records disposal schedule for these records shall remain in force until the status of the records contained in the schedule changes.

(d) Upon change in status of records or at any time an agency determines that records not within its records disposal schedule are no longer necessary for the conduct of business or for purposes of audit or litigation, the agency may request the Department to make appropriate amendments to its records disposal schedule.






*§ 1-05 Procedure for Annual Records Disposal.* ::


Following promulgation of an approved records disposal schedule pursuant to 49 RCNY § 1-04, the agency will certify to the validity and currency of their schedule annually on forms provided by the Department on a date agreed upon by each city agency and the Department.

(d) In no case shall any agency proceed with the destruction of records until the agency certification form is returned by both the Department and the corporation counsel indicating both have received and reviewed it.
