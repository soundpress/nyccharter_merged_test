NYC Charter
=================================

As part of the `1898 consolidation of New York City <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Greater_New_York>`_, the `New York State Legislature <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Legislature>`_ enacted a charter for the consolidated city. The Charter was overhauled in 1989, after the `New York City Board of Estimate <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Board_of_Estimate>`_ had been declared unconstitutional, to redistribute power from the Board of Estimate to the `Mayor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City>`_ and `City Council <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council>`_.
