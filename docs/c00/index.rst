***Volumes are based upon lightweight aggregate at a total moisture content of 8 percent in loose conditions as described in ASTM C29.

****These values may be increased based on the type, graduation and moisture content of the aggregates, delivery system and job conditions.

   (2) (i) The type, graduation and moisture content of the aggregate delivery system and job conditions may affect the slump necessary at the mixer for the proper conveying of the concrete. For these reasons in addition to the recommended mix established from the preliminary trial mix data obtained in accordance with § 27-605(a)(2), two alternative mixes also shall be recommended. These alternate mixes shall be based upon the water cement ratio curve in the preliminary test data to produce concrete having slumps greater than the maximum specified in § 27-605(a)(2) in increments of l-inch for concrete manufactured with gravel or stone aggregate best not to exceed 8 inches or increments of 2 inches for concrete manufactured with lightweight aggregates but not to exceed 9 inches.

      (ii) It shall be permissible to use these mixes interchangeably during the course of the work, providing the slump as the mixer is equal to or less than that provided for the applicable recommended mix.

      (iii) The recommended preliminary trial mix shall indicate the design unit weight in lbs. per cu. ft. of the fresh concrete and the estimated air dry unit weight at 56 days.

(c) Testing and inspection of controlled concrete. 

   (1) Those samples of concrete for test purposes required by RS 10-3, § 4.3.1. which are designated to be "taken out of the bucket, hopper or forms" shall be obtained by passing a receptacle completely through the discharge stream of the delivery line or by completely diverting the discharge into a container. Transport the sample concrete to the place where fresh concrete tests of slump, air content, temperature and unit weight are to be performed and where specimens for strength tests are to be molded in accordance with RS 10-51 and RS 10-52 as directed by the Architect or Engineer designated for controlled concrete inspection. Each of the foregoing three (3) test cylinders per one hundred and fifty (150) cubic yards required under § 4.3.1 of RS 10-3 shall be taken from a different delivery vehicle.

   (2) Where the concrete is discharged directly into the forms by pumping methods the slump taken at the end of the delivery line shall be used to determine conformance with the slump specified for the work.

   (3) The results of tests of samples taken at the end of the pump delivery line shall be shown on the same report with corresponding tests of samples taken from the same batch at the mixer.

   (4) (i) Included in the duties of the on-site inspector as provided by § 27-607 shall be:

         (A) That water is added only to the mixer or under the following circumstances to the hopper of the pump: When a portion of the concrete is discharged from the mixer into the pump hopper at a slump below that specified in the preliminary trial mix and too low for pumpability, water may be added to this concrete in the pump hopper to bring it to the specified slump provided all pumping action is stopped. Before pumping is resumed the concrete in the hopper must be thoroughly remixed for a minimum period of 2 minutes after all of the water has been added. If the concrete cannot be properly remixed it shall be removed from the hopper and discarded. The balance of the batch in the mixer shall be adjusted to the specified slump before further discharge.

         (B) Examination of the conveying line for leakage of cementitious material.

         (C) Verify that no aluminum pipe is used.

      (ii) Included in the duties of the batch plant inspector as provided for in § 27-605(a).

   (5) A.B., shall be:

      (i) To make adjustments for variations in fineness modulus of the fine aggregate as per ASTM C 33, Section 3.4. When the difference of fineness modulus of the fine aggregate is more than 0.2 for each 0.2:

         (A) Below the Design Fineness Modulus deduct 50 lbs. from the dry batch weight of the fine aggregates and add 50 lbs. for normal weight (20 lbs. lightweight) to the dry batch weight of the coarse aggregates.

         (B) Above the Design Fineness Modulus add 50 lbs. to the dry batch weight of the fine aggregate and deduct 50 lbs. for normal weight (20 lbs. lightweight) from the dry batch weight of the coarse aggregates.

      (ii) To test lightweight aggregates for total moisture content each day before the first concrete for the project is batched and thereafter at appropriate intervals during the day or whenever a moisture change may be evident. The moisture content of each test shall be reported on the corresponding inspection ticket accompanying each load of concrete.

      (iii) To immediately notify the concrete producer and the contractor when the total moisture content of the lightweight is 8 percent or less, that a change to an alternate mix may be necessary to maintain the water cement ratio and the slump specified for the work as determined at the end of the delivery line.

(d) Job practices.

   (1) Slump shall be maintained as uniformly as possible from batch to batch in conformance with the specified slump.

   (2) Delivery systems shall be in good condition. No dented or worn thin section shall be used.

   (3) All connections shall have clean grooves, be equipped with gaskets and securely coupled except at the end of the system where sections are being reconnected gaskets may be omitted.

   (4) All vertical risers shall be straight and firmly secured. Pipe bends shall also be restrained against movement caused by the pumping action.

   (5) Clean out procedures shall assure that there is no uncontrolled ejection of concrete or clean out devices at the end of the delivery line. If pressure water is used for cleanout, care shall be taken that the water is not deposited into the form.

   (6) Care shall be taken that portland cement and sand slurry used to prime the delivery line shall not be deposited in the form without the approval of the architect or engineer designated for Controlled Inspection. All other types of printing liquids shall not be permitted to be placed in the form.

   (7) Pumping aids, coloring agents, and all other admixtures shall be permitted only when included in the preliminary trial mix design.

   (8) Flexible hose, used in the system shall be handled so as to permit the full flow of the concrete without restriction, reduction of cross sectional area of kinking.

   (9) Free hanging, coupling connected sections of flexible delivery line shall have additional restraint between each section across each joint.

   (10) Personnel shall avoid standing close to the outlet end of the concrete pump.

(e) Quality control.

   (1) The engineer who designed the structure shall specify on his plans, or an amendment thereto, that concrete may be conveyed by pumping.

   (2) The placement of concrete by pumping shall be suspended on any project where required test reports are not submitted to the Borough Superintendent within six weeks from the date of placement and sampling.

Certification of residential hotel status as defined in 1 RCNY § 15-03(a) above shall be issued by the borough superintendent. Certification shall be valid for a period of one (1) year from the date of initial certification. Thereafter, the owner of the residential hotel shall engage a registered architect or licensed professional engineer to certify annually through the filing of a building notice application that the residential hotel is in compliance with the requirements of 1 RCNY § 15-03(a) above.

   (2) Owners of residential hotels shall keep a copy of their residential hotel certification on site at the hotel. Failure to timely renew a hotel's residential certification may result in the issuance of violations for the hotel's failure to comply with the requirements of Local Law 16 of 1984 and Local Law 16 of 1987 for a J-l occupancy.

(d) Supporting documentation. The following documentation shall be furnished by the owner in support of his or her application for certification of residential hotel status:

   (1) Certificate of Occupancy or, if unavailable;

   (2) Occupancy and Arrangement Card from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and Department of Housing Preservation and Development Computer Printout;

   (3) List all rooms occupied by tenants who have resided at the premises for six months or longer or who are in occupancy pursuant to a lease of six months or longer, together with the name of the tenant in each of the aforementioned rooms and copies of any and all existing leases for the period stated in 1 RCNY § 15-03(a) of this section; and

   (6) Any other documentation deemed relevant by the borough superintendent, in his or her discretion.

(e) Determination of J-2 Dormitory. 

   (1) A building owner may contend that his/her building is a dormitory and therefore as a J-2 occupancy need only provide stair and elevator signs, and if a high-rise building also remove locks on elevator and hoistway doors. To qualify as a dormitory, the building's current Certificate of Occupancy must indicate use as a dormitory. Where the Certificate of Occupancy indicates both dormitory and J-l occupancy, those portions which are J-l must comply with LL 16/84 requirements for J-1 occupancies.

   (2) When an owner seeks to amend his building's Certificate to provide for dormitory occupancy, he must submit an affidavit stating he will use the dormitory space only for sleeping accommodations of individuals on a month-to-month or longer-term basis (Adm. Code § 27-265) and that the dormitory will be owned and operated by either a not-for-profit corporation or a school. Such amended Certificates of Occupancy shall provide that the dormitory may only be owned or operated by either a not-for-profit corporation or a school.

*§ 15-06 Design of Composite Construction with Metal Decks or Lightweight Concrete.* ::


(a) Metal deck construction is to be approved strictly in accordance with Board of Standards and Appeals or MEA approval in all respects, with no interchangeability or equivalent materials authorized except as noted in these rules.

(b) When metal decks have been approved for use where a fire resistive floor or roof is required, equivalent materials may be authorized or interchanged for any of the components of the assembly by borough superintendents pursuant to § 27-107 of the Administrative Code based on

   (1) Similar full scale tests conforming with A.S.T.M. E119-1988; or,

   (2) A combination of small scale and/or half scale tests and engineering evaluation acceptable to the commissioner in conjunction with evaluation of full scale tests conforming with ASTM E119-1988 for a variety of assemblies of combination of materials, or

   (3) A combination of small scale, half scale or full size tests representative of the actual fire exposure of the occupancy and engineering evaluations, all acceptable to the commissioner.

(c) When metal decks have been approved for use where a fire resistive floor or roof is required without any fire protection below the metal deck, they shall not be authorized in connection with composite beam design unless the approval specifies that the decks have been tested in accordance with both floor and beam requirements; or, alternatively, fire protection is applied below the metal deck having the same thickness as that applied to the beam, for that width of slab acting as part of the composite beam, except that no such fire protection need be applied below the metal deck when the floor or roof slab and deck have a fire resistive rating at least equal to that of the supporting beams, ef'c of the concrete fill-in is equal to or greater than 3,000 p.s.i.

(d) Where the structural design is in accordance with load tests referred to in a board approval, the load carrying capacity can be accepted provided that design criteria for all structural elements are specified in the resolution of the board. Where the approval of the board simply makes general reference to other criteria, the following structural guidelines are to be adhered to, with respect to composite construction:

   (1) Concrete in the ribs of metal decks is to be completely excluded in flexural computations, in the composite T-beam design. However, it may be included for bond calculations (which is to be based on allowable stresses of 20 p.s.i.) as well as shear stresses for slab action exclusively.

   (2) Slab designs shall be required to comply with all applicable requirements of Reference Standards RS 10-3, and RS 10-5A with structural calculations submitted in all cases in regard to n ratios (see § 1102(b) of RS 10-3), fibre stresses, shear stresses, bond stresses, length-deep and/or deflection limitations, and shear connection loads.

   (3) The capacity of shear connectors in lightweight concrete shall only be rated at 80 percent of the values specified in Table 1.11.4 of Reference Standard RS 10-5 for normal weight aggregate. When metal decks with ribs not exceeding 1 and 1/2 inches in depth are used, the capacity of the shear connectors is to be further reduced by 15 percent, so as to have a total rated capacity of 65 percent of the values stated in Table 1.11.4 when lightweight concrete is used in composite construction with metal decks, and 85 percent when normal aggregate is used in such construction, unless prequalified load tests pursuant to § 27-599 warrant higher values. Shear connectors not listed in Table 1.11.4, or differing on length or size may not be used without specific Board approval for specific loads.

   (4) When metal decks having ribs exceeding 1 and 1/2 inches in height are employed with composite construction, prequalified load tests of the slab and beam, pursuant to § 27-599, shall be required before any approval is granted.

   (5) All welding or shear connectors shall be performed by licensed welders, except as otherwise authorized in an intradepartmental memorandum dated June 6, 1967.

Completely remove all existing materials to face of studs or other structural members on hall side of partitions and recover with plaster boards or perforated rock lath three-eighths inch (3/8") thick, covered with two coats of gypsum mortar (scratch and brown) so that the aggregate thickness shall be at least one inch (1"), or in lieu thereof, recover same with plaster boards one-half inch (1/2") thick, covered with No. 26 U.S. gauge stamped metal. In lieu of the above method, completely remove all combustible material from plaster face of partitions on hall side and repair existing plaster. After inspection, plaster boards or perforated rock lath may be applied directly over the existing plaster face of partitions on hall side. Cover plaster boards or perforated rock lath with two coats of gypsum mortar as above, or plaster boards may be covered with No. 26 U.S. gauge stamped metal.

   (3) Mineral wool. Fill solidly between partition uprights, from underside of flooring to ceiling with mineral wool blown in place by the pneumatic method, packed solidly to fill all spaces and voids.

   (4) Brick, gypsum, etc. Fill solidly between partition uprights from underside of flooring to ceiling with brick, gypsum, or other acceptable material packed solidly to fill all spaces and voids. Where brick, gypsum, or other masonry material is intended to be used, application must be filed before installation with the Department of Buildings for approval of strength of existing members intended to support the proposed masonry fire-retarding.

   (5) Other methods. No other method may be used unless same is acceptable to the Department of Housing and Buildings.

   (6) Removal of windows in public hall partitions. When windows in walls or partitions are removed, both sides of the openings shall be sealed with fire-retarding materials, except that wood lath and plaster may be used on the room side of the opening when the existing surface of the room is constructed of wood lath and plaster.

   (7) Electric meters. Where direct current (DC) electric meters of public utility companies are present or installed on partitions of public halls the fire-retarding shall continue unbroken behind the meters or the meters shall be mounted on a heavy slate back or non-magnetic fireproof equivalent, such as transite, asbestos board, etc., against which fire-retarding finished up tightly.

   (8) Partitions in Class B converted dwellings. Where fire retarding is required in any Class B converted dwelling referred to in 1 RCNY § 15-07(a)(7), both sides of all enclosure partitions of entrance halls, stair halls and public halls throughout such building shall be fire-retarded in accordance with the method set forth in 1 RCNY §§ 15-07(b)(1) or (b)(2) or said partitions shall be fire-retarded in accordance with the provisions of 1 RCNY §§ 15-07(b)(3) or (b)(4).

   (9) Partitions in altered old law tenements. In any old law tenement where the occupancy is increased on any story, the enclosing partitions of any entrance hall, stair hall or public hall on the story where the occupancy has been increased, shall be fire-retarded on both sides. Such requirements shall apply only to the walls of the entrance hall, stair hall or public hall adjoining the altered apartment. The enclosing partitions of such halls other than those adjoining the altered apartment and the partitions on any story where the occupancy has not been increased, shall be fire-retarded on the hall side. The method of fire-retarding shall be as set forth in 1 RCNY §§ 15-07(b)(1) or (b)(2), or said partitions shall be fire-retarded in accordance with the provisions of 1 RCNY §§ 15-07(b)(3) or (b)(4).

   (10) Newly constructed partitions. In any entrance hall, stair hall or public hall where any partition or part thereof is newly constructed, and where the plaster has been removed from any partition or part thereof, such partition shall be fire-retarded on both sides.

   (1) Where any entrance hall, public hall or stair hall, or any portion thereof, in any part of any old law tenement of converted dwelling is required to be fire-retarded that portion of any ceiling directly underneath any such entrance hall, public hall or stair hall shall be fire-retarded. Where such ceiling is located in any store, apartment or other space it shall also be fire-retarded as required for partitions by 1 RCNY §§ 15-07(b)(1) or (b)(2). Where the above method is impractical due to the existing ceiling construction in any such store, apartment or other space, the Department of Buildings may permit the fire-retarding of such ceilings to be applied from above by removing the floor of any such entrance hall, public hall or stair hall and installing between the floor beams, and directly against the ceiling below, a layer of heavy building paper over which there shall be placed a basket made of reinforced ribbed expanded metal lath weighing at least 3.4 pounds per square yard. Such basket shall be lined with Portland cement or gypsum mortar not less than one inch (1") in thickness. The building paper, metal lath and cement or gypsum mortar shall be carried at least halfway up on the sides of the beams. However, this method will not be accepted for the fire-retarding of any such ceiling located in a space used for a hazardous purpose or business, nor will it be accepted for the fire-retarding of any such ceiling located in the cellar or for the fire-retarding of any ceiling located in any store, apartment or other space when such ceiling is constructed of wood or of wood and metal applied directly to the beams. In such cases the ceilings shall be fire-retarded according to the requirements of 1 RCNY § 15-07(b)(1) or (b)(2).

(d) Existing wood stairs. Except where stairs of incombustible material are required in Class B converted dwellings as set forth in 1 RCNY § 15-07(a)(7), all wood railings, balustrades and newel posts shall be completely removed from every existing wood stairs and such stairs shall be provided with railings, balustrades and newel posts of metal or other hard incombustible material, of such size and secured in such manner to the existing stairs as may be approved by the Department of Buildings, except handrails may be of hardwood. Soffits and stringers of existing wood stairs shall be fire-retarded in accordance with the methods set forth in 1 RCNY §§ 15-07(e) or (f).

(e) Stair soffits. The soffits of every stair in every entrance hall, public hall, and stair hall, including any soffit extending beyond the enclosure partitions of any such hall, shall be fire-retarded. Any approved method for fire-retarding partitions shall be acceptable for fire-retarding stair soffits provided that all existing materials are completely removed to face of structural members of stair soffits.

(f) Fascia – stair and well. Fascia of outside stringer on rake of stairs, and well fascia at floor level, shall be fire-retarded their full depth to form complete seals with the soffits of stairs and ceilings of halls, respectively. Type of fire-retarding shall be one of those herein approved for ceilings of halls, or in lieu thereof, cover fascia with sheet asbestos not less than three-sixteenths inch (3/16") thick with joints well pointed over which there shall be an additional single layer of No. 26 U.S. gauge stamped metal or cover fascia with a single layer of No. 14 U.S. gauge steel.

(g) Fire-stopping. All partitions required to be fire-retarded shall be fire-stopped with incombustible material at floors, ceilings and roofs. Fire-stopping over partitions shall extend from the ceilings to the underside of the flooring or roofing above. Fire-stopping under partitions shall extend from the underside of flooring to ceiling below. All spaces between floor joints (directly over and under partitions) shall be completely filled the full depth of the joists. Any space from top of partition to underside of roof boarding shall be completely fire-stopped. Fire-stopping shall be done with brick, cinder concrete, gypsum, metal lath and Portland cement or gypsum mortar, mineral wool, or other materials acceptable to the Department of Buildings.

(h) Door openings. Except as provided in 1 RCNY §§ 15-07(h)(1) and (h)(2), all door openings into any public hall, entrance hall or stair hall which is required to be fire-retarded shall be equipped with self-closing protective assemblies having a fire-resistive rating of at least one hour.

   (1) In old law tenements where the number of apartments is not being increased, existing wood doors opening into public halls, entrance halls or stair halls may remain provided such doors are made to be self-closing ("Butterfly" spring hinges are not acceptable) and, provided further, all glazed transoms and panels in every such door are glazed with wire glass.

*§ 15-08 Fire-Retarding of Cellar Ceilings in Old Law Tenements and Converted Dwellings.* ::


(a) Intent. The fire-retarding rules herewith set forth are approved by the Department of Buildings for the existing multiple dwellings where the ceilings of the cellar or other lowest story is required, by § 85 and § 240, subdivision 3, Multiple Dwelling Law, and by § 27-2044, Housing Maintenance Code, to be fire-retarded in a manner approved by the Department of Buildings.

   (1) It is the intent of the law to provide a continuous fire-retarded covering over the entire ceiling of the cellar, or other lowest story, so as to prevent fire communicating with upper stories of a multiple dwelling. Where there is a space less than four feet six inches (4'-6") in height from the ground or floor level to the underside of the first tier of beams, such space shall be considered as an "air space" and not as a cellar. However, when such space opens to a cellar where fire-retarding of the ceiling is required, then such space shall be separated from the cellar with a partition constructed of incombustible material in which there is provided self-closing door and assembly having a fire-resistive rating of at least one hour. Where the ceiling of the cellar or other lowest story is required to be fire-retarded, all openings in such ceilings for stairways not located directly under a main stair, also openings in ceiling such as pipe shafts, vent shafts, unenclosed dumbwaiter shafts, disused flues, etc., shall be properly closed. (Private stairs within duplex apartments extending into cellar or basement are not required to be enclosed.) New partitions erected to enclose existing stair referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be of incombustible materials. Existing partitions enclosing any such stair will be acceptable where same are of incombustible materials or where same are fire-retarded on both sides in accordance with the methods set forth in 1 RCNY § 15-07(b)(1) or (b)(2) and with materials conforming with the requirement of 1 RCNY § 15-07(i). Door openings in such enclosure partitions shall be equipped with self-closing protective assemblies having fire-resistive ratings of at least one hour. When existing shafts, including dumbwaiter shafts, extend below the ceiling a distance less than one-half (1/2) the height of the cellar, such shafts shall be considered as being part of the cellar ceiling and the enclosures of said shafts shall be fire-retarded in the same manner as required for cellar ceilings. All existing shafts, including dumbwaiter shafts, which extend below the ceiling a distance more than one-half (1/2) the height of the cellar shall be enclosed with incombustible materials. All shafts referred to in this paragraph shall have adequate cleanout at base consisting of fire-proof self-closing door and assembly having a fire-resistive rating of at least one hour. Where new partitions or enclosures are erected in a cellar they shall be constructed of incombustible materials.

   (2) Wood girders, columns, posts, etc. The fire-retarding material of ceiling of cellar or other lowest story shall be carried down and around all non-fireproof ceiling projections, such as wood girders, etc., which are less than six inches by six inches (6" × 6") in dimension. The fire-retarding material also shall be turned down at least three inches (3") on all non-fire-retarding columns, posts, etc., which are less than six inches (6") in diameter.

   (3) Non-fire-retarded cellar partitions. When non-fire-retarded partitions in cellar, or other lowest story, extend to the ceiling, the fire-retarding material of the ceiling shall be turned down at least three inches (3") on said partitions, or the partitions shall be cut off at top to permit the fire-retarding of the ceiling to be continuous. Where, in any old law tenement three (3) stories and basement in height, there is also a cellar under the basement story, the ceiling of such cellar shall be fire-retarded; and also, in any such old law tenement, where the main entrance from the grade is to the first story that portion of the basement ceiling which is directly under the first story entrance hall, public hall and stair hall shall be fire-retarded. In every old law tenement three (3) stories and basement in height with no cellar under the basement, where the main entrance from the grade is to the basement story, the ceiling of the basement story shall be fire-retarded throughout. In any such old law tenement where the main entrance from the grade is to the first story no such fire-retarding will be required.

   (4) Heating appliances. The portion of the ceiling over any furnace, boiler or hot water heater shall be fire-retarded in accordance with the methods set forth in 1 RCNY §§ 15-07(b)(1) or (b)(2), and such fire-retarding shall extend for a distance of at least four feet (4'-0") beyond the sides and rear, and eight feet (8'-0") in front of such furnace or boiler.

   (5) It is not intended that these rules and regulations in themselves require plans to be filed. However, should any work involve structural changes, then plans are required to be filed in the Department of Buildings and such changes shall be subject to all other Rules and Regulations applicable thereto.

   (6) Work shall not commence until satisfactory evidence has been submitted to the Department of Buildings that compensation insurance has been obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Law.

(b) Methods. Cellar ceilings shall be fire-retarded according to any of the following methods: Metal lath and cement or gypsum mortar conforming to 1 RCNY § 15-07(b)(1). Plaster boards and gypsum mortar or stamped metal conforming to 1 RCNY § 15-07(b)(2). No. 26 U.S. gauge stamped metal over existing plastered ceiling, when erected without damage to the plaster. Furring strips are not required, but if used, they shall be metal covered on both sides and on face surface. Stamped metal shall not be applied until after existing plastered ceiling has been inspected and approved by an inspector of the Department of Housing and Buildings. No other method may be used unless same are acceptable to the Department of Buildings.

(c) Materials. Materials used shall be in accordance with the provisions of 1 RCNY §§ 15-07(i)(1), (i)(2) or (i)(3). Mineral wool, brick, gypsum or other masonry fill will not be accepted for fire-retarding cellar ceilings. No other materials may be used unless same are acceptable to the Department of Buildings.

*§ 15-10 Fire Escapes, Fire Stairs and Fire Towers.* ::


(a) Intent. These rules have been approved by the Department to supplement the provisions of § 53 of the Multiple Dwelling Law in relation to Fire Escapes, fire-stairs, etc. Where fire escapes serve as a means of exit from other than multiple dwellings, such fire escapes shall comply with the laws governing such occupancy. The voluntary erection of fire escapes on private residence buildings or business and residence buildings shall be in conformity with these rules and regulations unless otherwise directed by the Borough Superintendent of the Department of Buildings. It is the intent of these rules to cover only general conditions and they are not designed to cover specific or special cases. When such may occur the owner is required to consult the Department of Buildings and receive instructions before starting of work.

   (1) Fire escapes on multiple dwellings requiring new certificate of occupancy. Except as provided in 1 RCNY § 15-10(g)(2) re lodging houses, double-rung ladder type fire escapes will not be accepted when a new Certificate of Occupancy is required.

   (2) Alterations for increased occupancy. Where an alteration is made increasing occupancy on any story and a fire escape is required such fire escape shall conform to the provisions of § 53 of the Multiple Dwelling Law and to the applicable provisions of these rules.

(b) General provisions. 

   (1) Caution. No fire escapes shall be removed from any apartment without due precaution against leaving occupants without fire escape protection as required by subdivision 9 of § 53 of the Multiple Dwelling Law.

   (2) Entrance story, etc. – second means of egress. Where the distance to safe landing, from the window sill of any apartment on any story, including the entrance story, is more than twelve feet (12'-0"), a balcony and sliding drop-ladder or other approved second means of egress shall be provided for such apartment. Safe egress to street or other safe place shall be provided from the termination of such means of egress.

   (3) Application blanks and plans. Before the erection of new fire escapes or alteration of existing fire escapes upon any multiple dwelling, application must be filed with and approved by the Department of Buildings.

   (4) Projections beyond the building line. Every part of fire escapes or balconies erected on the fronts of multiple dwellings shall be at least ten feet (10') above the sidewalk when such fire escapes or balconies project beyond the building line.

(c) Illegal fire escapes shall be removed. All vertical ladder, wire, chain or cable fire escapes if required as a means of egress shall be removed and replaced with a legal means of egress.

(d) Acceptable existing means of egress on existing multiple dwellings. Except as provided in 1 RCNY § 15-10(c), in any existing multiple dwelling any existing means of egress which was lawfully permitted prior to the time the Multiple Dwelling Law became effective may be continued as a legal means of egress as hereinafter enumerated. If located on the front or rear wall of the building and properly connected with stairs with proper openings. If located in an outer court at a point distant not more than thirty feet (30'-0") from the outer end of such court and provided such court is not less than five feet (5'-0") in width from wall to wall at any point between such fire escape and the outer end of said court. If located in an inner court whose least horizontal dimension is not less than fifteen feet (15'-0") measured from wall to wall. If a party-wall balcony on the front or rear wall of the building and there are no doors or openings in the walls between the two buildings other than windows in fireproof air shafts. If a party-balcony located in an outer court not more than fifteen feet (15'-0") in length measured from the outer end of such court to the innermost point thereof, and not less than five feet (5'-0") in width from wall to wall at any point between the fire escape and the outer end of said court, and provided also that there are no doors or openings in the walls between the two buildings other than windows in fireproof air-shafts. No fire escape, however, shall be deemed sufficient unless all the following conditions are complied with: All fire escapes, whether a required means of egress or not, shall be maintained in good order, repair and structurally safe. All parts shall be of iron or stone. Except as provided in 1 RCNY § 15-10(bb) every apartment above the ground floor in each multiple dwelling shall have direct access to a legal fire escape without passing through a public hall. Except party-wall balconies, all balconies shall be connected to each other by means of a stair or, when permitted, by double-rung ladders. All fire escapes, except party-wall balconies, shall have proper drop-ladders in guides from the lowest balcony of sufficient length to reach a safe landing place beneath. All fire escapes not on the street shall have a safe and adequate means of egress from the yard or court to the street or to the adjoining premises. Prompt and ready access shall be had to all fire escapes. Except as provided in 1 RCNY § 15-10(bb), such access shall be through a living room or private hall in each apartment or suite of rooms at each story above the ground floor and shall not include the window of a stairhall, nor shall any such egress be obstructed by sinks or other kitchen fixtures, or in any other way. No existing fire escape shall be extended or have its location changed except with the written approval of the Department of Buildings. Where an existing apartment in a tenement house erected prior to April twelfth, nineteen hundred and one, is located entirely on a court and has no rooms opening on the street or yard, fire escapes hereafter provided for such apartments may be located in courts under the same conditions as prescribed for existing fire escapes in this subdivision. When wire, chain cable or vertical ladder fire escapes are permitted to remain on Multiple Dwellings under the provisions of subdivision 9 of § 53, they shall be considered only as supplemental fire escapes. Such fire escapes shall be maintained in a safe condition of repair at all times and shall be subject to the applicable requirements of all laws and to these rules in relation to maintenance of existing fire escapes. Before a pending violation requiring the removal of such existing fire escapes is superseded or cancelled, an inspection shall be made in accordance with the specific requirements as set forth in the preceding paragraph. Each of the owners of adjoining structures, commonly served by party-wall balconies serving as a required means of egress, shall maintain in good order and repair that portion of each such balcony which is on his property, and each such owner shall maintain egress normally unobstructed and unimpeded from each such balcony to and through his structure. It shall be unlawful for the owner of a structure on which there is a party-wall balcony serving as a required means of egress from an adjoining structure, to remove such party-wall balcony or any portion thereof or to prevent, eliminate or obstruct egress from such party-wall balcony to and through his structure, unless and until such owner has had erected a legal fire escape or other approved means of egress. See also 1 RCNY § 15-10(bb).

(e) Party-wall balconies. 

   (1) New party-wall balconies. The erection of new party-wall balconies shall be subject to the discretion and jurisdiction of the Department of Buildings, provided, however, that there shall be no doors or openings in the wall between the buildings served by such balconies other than windows in fireproof airshafts. New party-wall balconies will not be permitted on adjoining frame multiple dwellings.

   (2) Existing party-wall balconies. Party-wall balconies existing on any multiple dwelling shall afford safe egress, be kept in good order and repair, be constructed so as to be structurally strong and shall be maintained in conformity with all other applicable laws, rules and regulations. Such fire escapes are acceptable on occupied multiple dwellings.

(f) Party-wall fire escapes. The Department of Buildings my consent to the erection of party-wall fire escapes on adjoining multiple dwellings, to which the occupants have safe, unobstructed access in common, when such party-wall fire escapes are constructed and maintained in accordance with the law and these rules.

   (1) Any existing party-wall fire escape (stairways) connection with and used in common by a multiple dwelling and a non-multiple dwelling is acceptable when such fire escape is maintained in good order and repair and affords safe egress.

(g) Double-rung ladders.

   (1) Double-rung ladders will not be permitted on new fire escapes.

   (2) Any fire escape existing prior to the enactment of the Multiple Dwelling Law on any multiple dwelling that does not require a certificate of occupancy resulting from an alteration, if structurally sound and in good condition and provided with existing ladders inclined at an angle not exceeding eighty (80) degrees and equipped with double-rung steps and which affords safe egress, shall be deemed to be a legal fire escape. When a Certificate of Occupancy is requested or required in connection with a lodging house which is equipped with a double-rung ladder Fire Escape and such fire escape is in good repair and adequate, except as to type, and only minor violations exist the correction of which will make the premises conform to all other law requirements, the existing double-rung ladder fire escape may be accepted.

   (3) Except as provided in 1 RCNY § 15-10(g)(2) re lodging houses, double-rung ladders are not acceptable when a new Certificate of Occupancy is to be issued.

(h) Alteration of existing two-balcony fire escapes on existing multiple dwellings. When a building is not more than three (3) stories in height and provided with a balcony on each of the second and third stories, with connecting vertical ladders, and balconies not less than two feet five inches (2'-5") in width and of adequate length, the Department of Buildings may permit the removal of vertical ladders and replacing of the said ladders with regulation sixty (60) degree connecting stairs. Standards shall be one-half inch (1/2") round or square and height of rail at least two feet nine inches (2'-9"). The stairs shall be not less than seventeen inches (17") wide with a passageway between string and wall or string and top rail of not less than fourteen inches (14"). In lieu of such passageway, the Department of Buildings will permit a drop-ladder to be installed and placed at each end of the lowest balcony in those cases where it is impractical to provide a passageway of such minimum width. New brackets shall be provided where necessary. The gateway shall be cut in the front rail with a drop-ladder and guides from second (2nd) story to safe landing. Where fire escapes are located at rear of building a gooseneck ladder shall be provided. The gooseneck ladder may be placed at an angle from the top floor balcony to the roof. When placed at an angle a minimum space of twenty-four inches (24") shall be maintained between the strings and front top rail and a minimum space of fourteen inches (14") between the strings and the front bottom rail. There shall be a space of at least twenty-four inches (24") between the string of the gooseneck ladder and the frame of the window. Conditions may be found where this modification will not exactly apply. When such a condition is found it should be brought to the attention of the Department of Buildings for decision. When fire escapes are at the front no gooseneck ladder shall be required. When access to such existing two-balcony fire escape is solely by means of a window in a bathroom, the doors of such bathrooms shall be glazed with glass other than wire glass and all key or cylinder locks shall be removed from doors. In such bathrooms there shall be no fixture located in front of the window opening to fire escape. Such altered two-balcony fire escape shall conform to all other requirements of law and these rules and regulations.

(i) Accessibility of fire escapes from apartments, rooms, kitchenettes and other spaces. Prompt and ready access shall be had to all fire escapes and, except as provided in 1 RCNY § 15-10(bb), such access shall be through a living room, kitchenette or private hall in each apartment or suite of rooms at each story above the ground floor. Access to fire escapes shall not include the window of a stairhall, nor shall any such egress be obstructed by sinks or other kitchen fixtures, or in any other way. A clear space of at least twenty-one inches (21") must be maintained as a passageway between any fixtures and the side of an opening leading to fire escapes. In any apartment which is occupied by a "family" as defined in § 4(5), Multiple Dwelling Law, and in which one or more living rooms are rented to boarders of lodgers, every such room shall be directly accessible to a fire escape without passing through a public hall, and for separately occupied living rooms access to fire escapes shall be direct from such rooms without passing through a public hall or any other separately occupied room, except as may be permitted in §§ 66, 67, and 248 of the Multiple Dwelling Law.

   (1) Egress from apartments used for "Single Room Occupancy". No room in any apartment shall be so occupied for "single room occupancy" unless each room therein shall have free and unobstructed access to each required means of egress from the dwelling without passing through any sleeping room, bathroom or water-closet compartment. In apartments used for "single room occupancy" there shall be access to a second means of egress within the apartment without passing through any public stair or public hall. On and after July 1, 1957, every tenement used or occupied for single room occupancy in whole or part under the provisions of § 248, Multiple Dwelling Law, and which does not have at least two means of egress accessible to each apartment and extending from the ground story to the roof, shall be provided with at least two means of egress, or, in lieu of such egress, every stair hall or public hall, and every hall or passage within an apartment, shall be equipped on each story with one or more automatic sprinkler heads approved by the department. Elevator shafts in such tenements shall be completely enclosed with fireproof or other incombustible material and the doors to such shafts shall be fireproof or shall be covered on all sides with incombustible material.

Where skylights exist or are hereafter constructed on the roof of an extension used as a means of egress from a fire escape, they must not interfere with egress in any way and if in the line of said egress, they must be provided with a substantial guard-rail not less than three feet six inches (3'-6") high.

(n) Egress to street required from fire escapes located in yards and courts not extending to the street. In an old law tenement or a converted dwelling where fire escapes are located in a yard less than thirty feet (30'-0") in depth, or in a court which does not extend to such a yard or to the street, there shall be egress to the street by means of a fire-proof passageway. In such multiple dwellings, where the yard is less than thirty feet (30'-0") in depth and where the consent of the owner of the adjoining premises is obtained, in lieu of providing such fire-proof passageway, a door or gate in a lot-line fence leading from such yard or court to the yard or court of the adjoining premises may be accepted, provided, however, that such door or gate provides adequate egress and is not locked or secured in any manner except by a readily-accessible, easy to open hook or bolt. Where fire escapes are located in the yard of a new law tenement or of a multiple dwelling erected after April 18, 1929, access shall be provided from the street to the yard either in a direct line or through a court as provided in paragraph c of subdivision 2 of § 238 and paragraph i of subdivision 2 of Section 27, Multiple Dwelling Law. Where fire escapes are located in a court of a new law tenement or of a multiple dwelling erected after April 18, 1929, and such court does not extend to the street, a fireproof passageway leading directly to the street shall be provided as required by paragraph b of subdivision 2 of § 53, Multiple Dwelling Law. All passageways required under these rules shall be not less than seven feet (7'-0") in height and not less than three feet (3'-0") in width and shall at all times be kept clear and unobstructed. Doors and gates at the end of such passageways are prohibited, except that a door or gate equipped with an approved-type knob or panic belt which shall be readily openable from the inside will be permitted at the building line. Doors and gates provided with keylocks or padlocks are prohibited.

(o) Location for new fire escapes. No required fire-escape shall be permitted to be placed on an adjoining property without the written consent of the Department of Buildings.

   (1) Fire escapes in court (side yard). Except as provided in 1 RCNY § 15-10(bb)(6) where an apartment has a street frontage and extends also to a yard, fire escapes may be permitted to be placed in a court (side yard) if the court (side yard) is not less than seven feet (7'-0") wide. In any multiple dwelling where exterior structural conditions are such as to prevent the erection of a fire escape on the street front or yard, new fire escapes may be permitted to be erected in a lot-line court (side yard) providing the lot-line court (side yard) extends from street to rear yard and is not less than three feet (3'-0") in width for its full length. Fire escapes erected in such court may be three feet (3'-0") wide when the width of such court does not permit balconies three feet four inches (3'-4") in width. The width of stairways and passageways and other arrangement details affected by the permitted reduction in the width of balconies will be determined and furnished to contractor by the Department upon request.

   (2) Where an existing apartment in a tenement erected prior to April 12, 1901, is located entirely on a court and has no rooms opening on the street or yard, fire escapes hereafter provided for such apartments may be located in courts under the same conditions as prescribed for existing fire escapes in 1 RCNY § 15-10(d).

(p) Materials. All fire escapes hereafter constructed shall consist of outside open balconies and stairways of iron, stone, or other approved materials. Wherever the term wrought iron is used in these rules it shall be deemed to include all other especially approved metals. Cast iron will not be permitted to enter into the construction of fire escapes. The use of old material in the construction of new fire escapes is prohibited. Bolts used in the construction or repair of fire escapes shall be machine bolts. The use of stove bolts is prohibited.

   (1) Exceptions. Any such multiple dwelling, altered or erected after April fifth, nineteen hundred forty-four, and which is required to conform to the provisions of articles one, two, three, four, five, eight, nine and eleven of Multiple Dwelling Law, shall not be required to conform to the provisions of 1 RCNY § 15-10(bb)(1)(i), (2), (3) and (4).

      (i) Except in fireproof class A multiple dwellings erected under plans filed after January first, nineteen hundred twenty-five, and which were completed before December thirty-one, nineteen hundred thirty-three, and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (4) of subdivision (bb) of this section, in every such dwelling three (3) or more stories in height there shall be from each story at least two (2) independent means of unobstructed egress located remote from each other and accessible to each room, apartment or suite.

   (2) First means of egress. The first means of egress shall be an enclosed stair extending directly to a street, or to a yard, court or passageway affording continuous, safe and unobstructed access to a street, or by an enclosed stair leading to the entrance story, which story shall have direct access to a street. That area of the dwelling immediately above the street level and commonly known as the main floor, where the occupants are registered and the usual business of the dwelling is conducted, shall be considered a part of the entrance story; and a required stair terminating at such main floor or its mezzanine shall be deemed to terminate at the entrance story. An elevator or unenclosed escalator shall never be accepted as a required means of egress.

   (3) Second means of egress. The second means of egress shall be by an additional enclosed stair conforming to the provisions of 1 RCNY § 15-10(bb)(2), a fire-stair, a fire-tower or an outside fire escape. In a non-fireproof dwelling when it is necessary to pass through a stair enclosure which may or may not be a required means of egress to reach a required means of egress, such stair enclosure and that part of the public hall or corridor leading thereto from a room, apartment or suite, shall be protected by one (1) or more sprinkler heads; in a fireproof dwelling only that part of the hall or corridor leading to such stair enclosure need be so protected.

   (4) Required second means of egress – impractical. Where it is impractical in such existing dwellings to provide a second means of egress, the department may order additional alteration to the first means of egress and shafts, stairs and other vertical openings as the department may deem necessary to safeguard the occupants of the dwelling, may require the public halls providing access to the first means of egress to be equipped on each story with one (1) or more automatic sprinkler heads, and, in non-fireproof dwellings, may also require automatic sprinkler heads in the stair which serves as the only means of egress.

   (5) Public halls and corridors providing access to fire escapes. Public halls and corridors providing access to fire escapes, existing and new, are acceptable when a direct and uninterrupted line to travel to the fire escape is provided. Public halls and corridors providing access to fire escapes shall be fire-retarded or shall be equipped with automatic sprinkler heads. The fire-retarding and sprinkler installation shall be in conformity with the rules and regulations of this department and as required by § 67(3) of the Multiple Dwelling Law. All openings which provide direct access to an existing fire escape from a public hall or corridor shall be equipped with fireproof doors and assemblies with the doors self-closing or fireproof windows glazed with clear wire glass. Access to new fire escapes from such halls or corridors shall be by means of fireproof doors and assemblies with doors self-closing. Doors providing access to fire escapes from public halls or corridors may be glazed with clear wire glass.

   (6) Fire Escapes – existing and new. Existing fire escapes which are structurally strong and in good repair, having connecting stairways set at an angle of not more than sixty-five (65) degrees, may be accepted as a secondary means of egress. Except as otherwise required herein, new and existing fire escapes shall be provided with a safe landing and the termination shall lead directly to a street or to a passageway which provides access to a street. When it is impractical to provide a termination for fire escapes as specified in these rules, the Department may accept a termination from such fire escapes which leads to safety.

   (7) Supplementary means of egress. A stair, fire-stair, fire-tower, or fire escape which is supplementary to the egress requirements of 1 RCNY § 15-10(bb)(2), (3) and (4), need not lead to the entrance story or to a street, or to a yard or a court which leads to a street, provided the means of egress therefrom is approved by the Department. Fire escapes which are supplementary to the required second means of egress, including fire escapes of the inclined ladder and vertical ladder types, may remain on the dwelling if maintained in good order and repair, are structurally strong and safe and are provided with safe landing and the termination thereof leads to safety in a manner satisfactory to this Department.

   (8) Signs – supplementary means of egress. Supplementary stairs, fire-stairs, fire-towers or fire escapes which do not lead to tthe entrance story or to a street, or to a yard or court leading to a street, shall be clearly marked "NOT AN EXIT" in black letters at least four inches (4") high on a yellow background and at the termination of each such stair, fire-stair, fire-tower or fire escape, there shall be a directional sign indicating the nearest means of egress leading to a street. All signs shall be constructed, located and illuminated in a manner satisfactory to the department.

   (9) Signs – general provisions. Every means of egress shall be indicated by a sign reading "EXIT" in red letters at least eight inches (8") high on a white background, or vice versa, illuminated at all time during the day and night by a red light of at least twenty-five (25) watts or equivalent illumination. Such light shall be maintained in a keyless socket. On all stories where doors, openings or passageways giving access to any means of egress are not visible from all portions of such stories, directional sign shall be maintained in conspicuous locations, indicating in red on a white background, or vice versa, the direction of travel to the nearest means of egress. At least one sign shall be visible from the doorway of each room or suite of rooms. Existing signs and illumination may be accepted if, in the opinion of the Department, such existing signs and illumination serve the intent and purpose of this subdivision.

   (10) Stairs, fire-stairs and fire-towers. Stairs, fire-stairs and fire-towers hereafter provided shall be constructed according to plans and applications approved by the Department of Buildings.

(cc) Egress: lodging houses.

   (1) Arrangement. There shall be at least two (2) means of unobstructed egress from each lodging-house story, which shall be remote from each other. The first means of egress shall be to a street either directly or by an enclosed stair having unobstructed direct access thereto. If the story is above the entrance story, the second means of egress shall be by an outside fire escape constructed in accordance with the provisions of section fifty-three, Multiple Dwelling Law, or by an additional enclosed stair. Such second means of egress shall be accessible without passing through the first means of egress.

   (2) Doors and windows. All doors opening upon entrance halls, stair halls, other public halls or stairs, or elevator, dumbwaiter or other shafts, and the door assemblies, shall be fireproof with the doors made self-closing by a device approved by the department, and such doors shall not be held open by any device whatever. All openings on the course of a fire escape shall be provided with such doors and assemblies or with fireproof windows and assemblies, with the windows self-closing and glazed with wire glass, such doors or windows and their assemblies to be acceptable to the department.

   (3) Aisles. There shall be unobstructed aisles providing access to all required means of egress in all dormitories. Main aisles, approved as such by the department to provide adequate approaches to the required means of egress, shall be three feet (3'-0") or more in width, except that no aisles need be more than two feet six inches (2'-6") wide if it is intersected at intervals of not more than fifty feet (50'-0") by cross-over aisles at least three feet (3'-0") wide leading to other aisles or to an approved means of egress.

   (4) Signs. Every required means of egress from the lodging-house part of the dwelling shall be indicated by a sign reading "EXIT" in red letters at least eight inches (8") high on a white background illuminated at all times during the day and night by a light of at least twenty-five (25) watts or equivalent illumination. Such light shall be maintained in a keyless socket. On all lodging-house stories where doors, openings, passageways or aisles are not visible from all portions of such stories, and in other parts of the dwelling which may be used in entering or leaving the lodging-house part and in which a similar need exists, signs with easily readable letters at least eight inches (8") in height, and continuously and sufficiently illuminated by artificial light at all times when the natural light is not sufficient to make them easily readable, shall be maintained in conspicuous locations, indicating the direction of travel to the nearest means of egress. At least one (1) such sign shall be easily visible from the doorway of each cubicle.

   (5) Roof egress. Access from the public hall at the top story to the roof shall be provided by means of a bulkhead or a scuttle acceptable to the Department. Every such scuttle and the stair or ladder leading thereto shall be located within the stair enclosure.

   (6) Persons accommodated. The number of persons accommodated on any story in a lodging house shall not be greater than the sum of the following components:

      (i) Twenty-two (22) persons for each full multiple of twenty-two inches (22") in the smallest clear width of each means of egress approved by the Department, other than a fire escape.

      (ii) Twenty persons (20) for each lawful fire escape accessible from such story if it is above the entrance story.

   (7) In view of the fact that § 66, Subdivision 3 (formerly § 13, subdivision m), Multiple Dwelling Law, required lodging houses to be sprinklered throughout, including the public halls, the Department will accept existing double-rung ladder type fire escapes on the condition that such fire escapes are maintained in a good state of repair.

(dd) Ladders leading to roof scuttles. Ladders to roof scuttles as required under the provisions of §§ 187 and 233 of the Multiple Dwelling Law, shall be of incombustible material, not less than fifteen inches (15") wide, with strings not less than one and one-half inches by three-eighths inch (1 1/2" × 3/8"), with five-eighths inch (5/8") rungs not more than twelve inches (12") apart.

These regulations shall apply to high pressure steam piping system which is defined as a system operating at a steam pressure of more than fifteen (15) psi. In the application of these rules and regulations, loops, bends or offsets of the piping shall not be considered expansion joints.

(a) Existing systems. The following requirements are applicable:

   (1) All expansion joints, anchorage and guides which are presently not accessible to permit a complete visual inspection, shall be made accessible. Where the integrity of any shaft enclosure is impaired hereby, proper means shall be provided to maintain its integrity. All joints, including the joints so exposed, shall be inspected for any signs, visual or audible, or any escaping steam or condensation. Where there is evidence of such escaping steam in a bellows joint, immediate appropriate action shall be taken including expeditious replacement of the joint. If the escaping steam is immediately adjacent to a tenanted area, the occupants of this area shall be evacuated and shall not be permitted to return until the joint has been replaced or removed. In all cases, the joint shall be kept under intensive surveillance by the owner until such replacement or removal. In the event that the leak is progressive and has progressed to an extent as to present a hazard, the steam system or any part thereof serviced by the affected joint shall be shut down and the Department of Buildings shall be notified immediately. The Commissioner may waive the requirement for the exposure of the structural attachments to the building of the anchorage or guides upon the certification of a professional engineer to the effect that the exposure would impair a structural element of the building and specifying the basis on which he predicates his conclusion as to the adequacy of the structural attachments to the buildings of the anchorage or guides without such exposure. Upon exposure and initial inspection of the joints, the Commissioner shall be notified in writing by registered or certified mail. Such notification shall specify the type and location of the joints and the date inspected. The notification shall also contain the name of the person responsible for seeing that the inspections are made and properly recorded. Such inspections and exposure shall be made within two weeks from the effective date of this requirement. The initial inspection of the anchorage and guides shall be made within two months from the effective date of this requirement. The Commissioner shall be notified in the same manner described above of any subsequent change of the person responsible for seeing that the inspections are made and records kept. The notifications required in this paragraph shall be addressed to the Borough Superintendent of the Borough in which the system is located.

   (2) Maintenance inspections.

      (i) Expansion joints shall be inspected weekly.

      (ii) The anchorage and guides shall be inspected annually. Exposure of the structural attachments to the buildings of the anchorages or guides shall not be required where the inspection reveals no improper movement or defects in the system.

*§ 29-01 Installation of Automatic Sprinklers in Halls and Rooms in Class "A" Multiple Dwellings Used for Single-Room Occupancy Under the Provisions of Subdivision 7-A of § 4 and § 248 of the Multiple Dwelling Law.* ::


(a) Before the installation of any sprinkler system in any single-room occupancy building is begun, an application, together with plans and specifications for such installation shall be filed with and approved by the Department of Buildings. Plans shall show accurately, both horizontally and vertically, the arrangement and dimensions of the private halls and rooms and the areas to be sprayed by each sprinkler head. Application and specification forms may be obtained at the borough office of the Department of Buildings. Applications shall be filed in the department office in the borough in which the premises are located. Applications and specifications shall be in triplicate. Preliminary plans may be on paper. Final plans shall be filed in triplicate on paper and microfilmed. When it is proposed to supply a sprinkler system by means of a direct connection to a public water supply main, the specifications shall be accompanied by a letter from the Department of Environmental Protection, establishing the fact that the water-supply conditions and pressures are suitable to meet the requirements of these rules for water supplies for sprinklers.

(b) Sprinkler systems shall be of the automatic wet type.

(c) Water supply from public water mains will be acceptable when such supply will provide a minimum static pressure at the highest sprinkler head or heads of not less than 15 pounds per square inch. Taps connecting to public water mains must be equal in size to the main pipe line, except that: A two-inch (2") tap connecting to the public water main and immediately increased to two-and-one-half inches (2 1/2") direct connection to the public water main and, A one-and-one-half inch (1 1/2") tap connecting to the public water main and immediately increased to two inches (2") in diameter, with piping of the same diameter extending into the building, shall be considered the same as a two-inch (2") direct connection to the public water main. The sprinkler system of each building shall have a separate and independent source of supply. When a sprinkler system is supplied direct from a public water main, it shall be separately and independently connected to the public water main. However, a house service water supply connection may be taken from the sprinkler water supply connection to the public main, on the house side of the main shut-off valve for the building, provided the diameter of the house service water supply connection does not exceed one-half of the diameter of the sprinkler water supply connection. Only one connection of the domestic water supply to the sprinkler water supply line shall be permitted and no shut-off valve shall be placed on the sprinkler supply line other than the main shut-off valve for the building on the street side of the house service water supply connection.

(d) A gravity tank upon the roof will be required when the normal minimum water pressure from the public mains is insufficient, or, in lieu of a gravity tank, a pressure tank may be installed in the basement or cellar in accordance with the requirements hereafter specified in these rules. The bottom of each gravity tank supplying the sprinkler system shall be elevated at least 20 feet above the roof. Each gravity tank shall be filled through a fixed water supply tank of at least one-and-one-half inch (1 1/2") diameter and independent of the sprinkler pipe system, by means of an automatically controlled pump of a discharge capacity of at least 65 gallons per minute against the total head, including friction at the discharge nozzle of the pump. The tank fill line shall be standard weight pipe, galvanized steel, or brass or copper pipe. A gravity tank, if used exclusively to supply the sprinkler system, shall have an effective capacity of not less than 1,500 gallons. Gravity tanks which serve both the house supply and the sprinkler system shall have a capacity of not less than 2,500 gallons. All exposed water supply piping connecting with roof gravity tanks shall be properly protected against frost action by four layers of one inch (1") high-grade hair felt, and each layer of hair felt shall be covered with a layer of heavy tar paper. Each wrapping must be securely fastened with heavy twine, and wrapping joints shall have a lap of not less than two inches (2"), staggered with the laps of adjacent layers. All coverings shall be finally covered with heavy canvas, and painted with two coats of water-proof paint. In lieu of the foregoing, three inch thick fiberglass in a metal shield may be used.

(e) Pressure tanks when used shall be capable of supplying actual water volume as required in subdivision (j) of this section of these rules. The required water volume shall be two-thirds of the tank capacity and that air pressure one-third. For the pressure to be maintained, pressure tanks shall be constructed and tested in accordance with the requirements of the ANSI/NFiPA 22 of Reference Standard RS 17-10 of the Administrative (Building) Code. At the end of each pressure tank there shall be a glass water level gauge, and the pressure tank must also be provided with a pressure gauge and manhole for access to the tank. The filing pump for the pressure tank shall have a capacity of 65 gallons per minute with sufficient strength to pump water into the pressure tank against full air pressure. The air compressor for the pressure tank must be capable of delivering ten cubic feet of air per minute for the permanent maintenance of the required maximum air pressure in the tank. The filling pipe from pump to air compressor must be provided with a relief valve set at 15 pounds in excess of the maximum air pressure carried in the tank.

(f) All tanks shall be supported in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative (Building) Code. All tanks shall be provided with emergency outlets in conformity with § P107.8(c) of Reference Standard RS-16 of the Administrative (Building) Code.

(g) Standard one-half inch (1/2") spray type sprinkler heads. Each private hall and room within an apartment having single-room occupancy shall be sprinklered as hereinafter provided. In private halls within apartments, sprinkler heads shall be placed not more than fourteen feet (14') apart. No sprinkler head in a hallway shall be distant more than seven feet (7') from a wall, partition or end of the hall. No sprinkler protection will be required within any closet with a floor area of not more than 20 square feet provided such closet is within a room and the area of the closet is considered as part of the room area in computing the required number of heads.

(h) The term "protected area" shall be construed to mean that single-room occupancy apartment within the building requiring the greatest number of sprinkler heads. In computing the required number of heads within a "protected area," the number of heads within the same apartment may be used on the condition that there is no connection to another apartment or private hall. Whenever there is a direct connection between two adjoining apartments, either or both of which are used for single-room occupancy, the combined connected apartments and private halls shall be considered as the "protected area." In computing the required number of heads in a "protected area" of this type, the number of heads within the rooms in the connected apartments or the number of heads required in the private halls of such connected apartments, whichever is greater, shall be used.

(i) The total number of heads in the "protected area" requiring the greatest number of heads shall determine the required size of the main supply, including service mains, main branch, tank, down feed and riser, but in no case shall the size of the main supply be less than two inches.

(j) There shall be sufficient actual water volume to supply 25 percent of the heads in the "protected area" requiring the greatest number of heads for a period of 20 minutes at 20 gallons per minute.

(k) The number of sprinkler heads on a given size of piping shall not exceed the following:

*§ 29-06 Installation of Automatic Sprinklers in the Public Halls of Multiple Dwellings Under the Provisions of § 187 (Converted Dwellings) and § 218, Subdivision 5 (Old-Law Tenements), of the Multiple Dwelling Law, and of the Sprinklers in Cooking Spaces in all Types of Multiple Dwellings Under the Provisions of § 33 of the Multiple Dwelling Law.* ::


(a) Certification from the Department of Environmental Protection. When it is proposed to supply a sprinkler system by means of a direct connection to a public water supply main, the specifications shall be accompanied by a letter or other approved certification from the Department of Environmental Protection, establishing the fact that the water supply conditions and pressure are such that will meet the requirements of these rules for water suppliers for sprinklers.

(b) Type of system required. Sprinkler system shall be of the automatic wet type.

(c) Connection to water main. The sprinkler system of each building shall have a separate and independent source of supply except as herein otherwise specifically provided. When a sprinkler system is supplied direct from a public water main, it shall be separately and independently connected to the public water main except that one street main supply will be accepted for not more than three contiguous buildings under one ownership where such buildings are separated by fire walls, provided that the supply is brought into the center building of a group of three, and provided further, that the supply shall be adequate for the total number of sprinklers in any two buildings, but not less than 50 percent of the total number of sprinklers in all the buildings in any case. In all other respects, the installation in each building shall comply with these rules. When one street supply serves more than one building, there shall be submitted to the department evidence that an easement has been created in favor of each building for the continued use of such supply for each building. A house service water supply connection may be taken from the sprinkler water supply connection to the city main, on the house side of the main shut-off valve for the building provided the diameter of the house service water supply connection does not exceed one-half of the diameter of the sprinkler water supply connection. Only one connection of the domestic water supply to the sprinkler water supply line shall be permitted and no shut-off valve shall be placed on the sprinkler supply line, other than the main shut-off valve for the building on the street side of the house service water supply connection. (1 RCNY § 29-06(c) amended by resolution filed with City Clerk February 9, 1956.)

(d) Water pressure and supply. Water supply from public water mains will be acceptable when such supply will provide a minimum static pressure at the highest sprinkler of not less than 15 pounds per square inch. For computation of the required water pressure at the curb level to provide adequate pressure at the highest sprinkler, the following formula shall be used: Required water pressure in pounds per square inch = 0.434 H plus 15. Where H = height in feet from the curb level to the level of the highest sprinkler. When the minimum pressure in the water supply is insufficient to provide the required pressure, but is capable of providing a pressure of not less than five pounds per square inch at the highest sprinkler, an automatic centrifugal booster pump for the purpose of increasing the water pressure will be accepted under the following conditions:

   (1) The rated capacity of the pump shall be not less than 250 gallons per minute and shall be sufficient to supply at least 25 percent of the total number of sprinklers, or where there is insufficient pressure in the top story only, all the sprinklers on the top floor, at the rate of 20 gallons per minute per sprinkler. A 2 1/2-inch diameter test tee shall be attached to the discharge pipe from the pump for the purpose of testing its capacity.

   (2) There shall be a pressure regulator attached to the pump which shall be set so that the pump will automatically start operating when the water pressure at the highest sprinkler falls below 20 pounds per square inch, and cease to operate when the said pressure reaches 30 pounds per square inch.

   (3) The pump shall be attached on bypass properly valved to the sprinkler main on the house side of the main control valve. The intake and discharge pipes to the pump shall be of sufficient size to deliver the required volume of water to the system at the stated minimum pressure.

   (4) Drain valves shall be installed on the main between the main (O.S.&amp;Y.) control valve and the intake connection to the pump and on the house side of the discharge connection to the pump. Such drain valves shall be closed by means of screw plugs.

   (5) A check valve shall be installed on the main on the inside service between the intake and discharge connections to the pump.

   (6) The intake and discharge pipes from the pump shall each be provided with an O.S.&amp;Y. valve.

   (7) A variation of not more than two pounds per square inch, in the minimum pressure, in the street supply below the required pressure for the sprinkler system without the introduction of a booster pump or increased size in piping may be accepted by the Superintendent if in his opinion the supply is adequate. There shall be sufficient actual water volume to supply 25 percent of the heads for a period of 20 minutes at 20 gallons per minute.

(e) Roof tanks. Except as otherwise specifically provided in 1 RCNY § 29-06(d), a gravity tank upon the roof will be required when the normal minimum water pressure from the public water main is insufficient. The bottom of each gravity tank supplying a sprinkler system shall be elevated at least 20 feet above the roof. Each gravity tank shall be filled through a fixed water supply pipe of at least one and one-half inch diameter and independent of the sprinkler pipe system, by means of an automatically controlled pump of a capacity at the discharge nozzle of the pump of at least 65 gallons per minute against the total head, including friction. The tank fill line shall be standard weight pipe, galvanized steel, brass or copper pipe. The pump shall be equipped with control apparatus which will automatically start operation when the effective capacity of the tank falls below the minimum reserve supply for the sprinkler system. A gravity tank, if used exclusively to supply the sprinkler system, shall have an effective capacity of not less than fifteen hundred (1,500) gallons. Gravity tanks which serve both the house supply and the sprinkler system shall have an effective capacity of not less than twenty-five hundred (2,500) gallons with a minimum of fifteen hundred (1,500) gallons reserved for the sprinkler system. All exposed water supply piping connecting with roof gravity tanks shall be properly protected against freezing by four layers of one inch high-grade hair felt, and each layer of hair felt shall be covered with a layer of heavy tar paper. Each wrapping shall be securely fastened with heavy twine, and wrapping joints shall have a lap of not less than two inches staggered into the laps of the adjacent layers. All coverings shall be finally covered with heavy canvas sewed at seams and painted with two coats of waterproof paint. In lieu of the foregoing, three inch thick fiberglass in a metal shield may be used. Exposed gravity tanks on the roof shall be protected against freezing by means of an approved enclosure, insulation, heating coil or other means acceptable to the Super- intendent. Gravity tanks shall be supported in accordance with the provisions of § P107.8 of Reference Standard RS-16 of the Administrative (Building) Code. Gravity tanks shall be provided with emergency outlets in conformity with § P107.8 of Reference Standard RS-16 of the Administrative (Building) Code.

(f) Pressure tanks. Except as otherwise specifically provided in 1 RCNY §§ 29-06(d) and (e), a pressure tank will be required when the normal minimum water pressure from the public main is insufficient. Such pressure tank may be installed in the basement or cellar. Pressure tanks when used shall be capable of supplying actual water volume as required in 1 RCNY § 29-06(d) at a pressure of not less than 15 pounds per square inch. Pressure tanks shall be constructed and tested in accordance with the requirements of ANSI/NFiPA 22 of Reference Standard RS 17-10 of the Administrative (Building) Code. Pressure tanks shall be at least two-thirds filled with water and an air pressure by gauge shall be maintained in the tank of not less than 75 pounds plus the pressure caused by the column of water in the sprinkler system above the bottom of the tank. At the end of each pressure tank there shall be a glass water-level gauge, and the pressure tank shall also be provided with a pressure gauge and a manhole for access to the interior of the tank. The filling pump for the pressure tank shall have a capacity of not less than 65 gallons per minute against the total head including friction and air pressure of the tank. The compressor shall be powered by an electric motor which shall be equipped with control apparatus, which will automatically start the motor when the pressure in the tank drops to 75 pounds per square inch and will cut out the motor when the pressure in the tank reaches the total required pressure. The air compressor shall be capable of delivering not less than 10 cubic feet of air per minute. The filling pipe from the pump or air compressor shall be provided with a relief valve set to open at 15 pounds in excess of the maximum air pressure required in the tank.

(g) Sprinkler pressure, where required. Sprinklers shall be arranged to spray all parts of the public stairways, service stairways, their hallways, landings and soffits. Sprinkler protection shall be provided also in each closet opening on a public hall and in any permanent telephone booth placed in a public hall, but no sprinkler protection shall be required in any bathroom, water-closet compartment or shower room opening upon a public hall. There shall be two or more sprinklers installed under the soffit of each public stairs spaced not more than fourteen (14) feet apart. Sprinklers shall be provided over and under the stairway leading from the basement or cellar to the first floor, except that where the under part of the cellar stairway is completely enclosed with fireproof material, sprinklers will not be required under the soffit of such cellar stairway. Sprinkler protection shall be provided in spaces exceeding three (3) feet in height, above a public hall between the ceiling of the top story and the roof unless such spaces are properly cut off from the public hall by means of fire retarded partitions. Sprinkler protection shall be provided also on the underside of public stairhalls, stair landings and soffits which are not within stair enclosures except when such surfaces are fire-retarded. Sprinklers shall not be required in roof bulkheads or in unheated outside street vestibules. Sprinkler protection shall not be required in any auxiliary stairway extending from the lowest story to the next higher story above, on condition that such stairway is not located under any stairway leading to upper stories nor terminates in a public hall. Deflectors of sprinklers shall be placed not less than three inches nor more than ten inches below ceilings or soffits. Sprinklers shall not be located within 12 inches distance of any obstruction such as hanger, lighting fixture, etc.

(h) Tap sizes required. Taps connecting to public water mains shall be equal in size to the main pipe lines, except that: A two and one-half inch tap connecting to the public water main and immediately increased to three inches in diameter, with piping of the same diameter extending into the building, shall be considered the same as a three inch direct connection to the public water main. A two inch tap connecting to the public water main and immediately increased to two and one-half inches in diameter, with piping of the same diameter extending into the building, shall be considered the same as a two and one-half inch direct connection to the public water main. A one and one-half inch tap connecting to the public water main and immediately increased to two inches in diameter, with piping of the same diameter extending into the building, shall be considered the same as a two inch direct connection to the public water main.

(i) Pipe schedules. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the number of sprinklers on a given size of piping shall not exceed the following:

~

The sprinkler main shall not be less in size than the sprinkler riser and shall not be less in size than any branch it serves. Except as otherwise specifically provided in 1 RCNY § 29-06(h), the total number of sprinklers in a structure shall determine the required size of the tap, service main, risers and branches, but in no case shall the size of the main supply be less than two inches. The following sprinklers will not be counted in computing the size of the taps, mains and risers:

   (1) One sprinkler of the required sprinklers placed under the soffits of the stairs in each story when more than one sprinkler is provided.

   (2) Sprinklers placed in any closet or telephone booth opening upon a public hall.

   (3) Sprinklers placed (in lieu of fire retarding) on the underside of public stairhalls, stair landings and soffits not within the stair enclosure. The permissible number of heads may at the discretion of the Superintendent be increased by not more than 10 percent.

(j) Siamese. A sprinkler system containing 55 or more sprinklers in one building or fire area, shall be provided with an approved Fire Department Siamese Connection installed in accordance with § 27-940 of the Administrative (Building) Code.

(k) Sprinkler in existing cooking spaces. When a sprinkler is installed in the ceiling over an existing cooking space, pursuant to § 33 of the Multiple Dwelling Law, the sprinkler shall be connected with the domestic water supply of the building through a pipe of at least one inch diameter, at a point either side of the valve controlling the supply to the plumbing fixture in the cooking space. There shall be at least one sprinkler for every 49 square feet or fraction thereof of the floor area of the cooking space. Such sprinklers shall not be included in the computations for determining the size of the sprinkler piping or the necessity of a siamese as outlined in 1 RCNY §§ 29-06(i) and 29-06(j). No sprinkler shall be installed in a cooking space without a written approval from the Department of Buildings. The Superintendent may, however, waive the requirement as to the filing of the plans when, in his opinion, the nature of the alteration may be fully explained in the application.

(l) Valves. Each valve controlling water supply and each valve controlling drainage of system or test flow, shall bear a metal plate securely attached to the valve and indicating clearly the purpose of each such valve. On the sprinkler main, an outside screw and yoke gate valve, readily accessible, shall be provided near the front wall of the building and located so as to control the water supply to all of the interior sprinkler system. The said outside screw and yoke gate valve shall be sealed in an open position. If a roof tank is used as a supply for sprinklers, an outside screw and yoke gate valve shall be provided in the piping leading from the tank to the sprinkler system, under conditions similar to those specified for such valves on sprinkler mains. A check valve of equal diameter to the main shall be installed in all sprinkler mains where a building is supplied by services connected to different street mains, or where a building is equipped with a siamese connection. Such check valve shall be placed within two feet of the outlet side of the main control valve. Where a sprinkler system is supplied with both a gravity tank and a street main, a check valve shall be placed in the independent supply pipe to the tank (on the tank side of the pump) and in the main at the outlet end of the main control valve. Such check valves shall be of equal diameter to the supply pipe and the main respectively. When the sprinkler system has an auxiliary supply in the form of a siamese connection, a check valve shall be placed in a horizontal position in the down feed from the gravity tank and immediately below the roof. When a building is supplied through a pressure tank in the cellar or basement, a check valve of equal diameter to the main shall be placed in the sprinkler main on the inside service between the intake and discharge connections to the pump feeding the pressure tank. Where a sprinkler system is equipped with a booster pump, valves shall be provided in accordance with 1 RCNY § 29-06(d). All control valves in supplies to the sprinkler system shall be sealed in an open position in an approved manner. Where an underground main is used, the main control valve shall be located where readily accessible.

(m) Drainage. All sprinkler pipe and fittings shall be so installed that the system can be thoroughly drained. Where practicable, all piping shall be arranged to drain to the main drain valve. Where this is impracticable, as in the case of sprinkler piping under stair soffits, a three-quarter inch screw plug shall be provided in the lower end of such piping to permit drainage. Except where otherwise provided in the previous paragraph, sprinkler pipes shall be pitched not less than one-quarter inch in the 10 feet. Pipe shall be straightened before installation to prevent pockets which would interfere with proper drainage. For draining the sprinkler system, a three-quarter inch tee branch with a three-quarter inch plugged valve shall be provided on the sprinkler main on the house side of the main (O.S.&amp;Y.) control valve. Where a sprinkler system is provided with check valves, the intermediate pipe between check valves shall be so arranged as to properly drain.

(n) Sprinkler specifications. Sprinklers shall be of a type and manufacture approved by the Board of Standards and Appeals and of current issue. The operating temperature of all sprinklers shall be in the ordinary degree range. Appropriate higher degree operating temperatures shall be required in cooking spaces. Any sprinkler which has opened or has been damaged shall be replaced immediately with a good sprinkler. There shall be kept available on the premises at all times at least three extra sprinklers and also a sprinkler wrench for use to replace any fused or damaged sprinklers.

(o) Pipe specifications – sleeves. All piping except underground piping used in sprinkler systems shall be full weight standard steel threaded pipe, well reamed and screwed up tight into fittings without reducing the waterway. Fittings shall be standard weight cast-iron. All fittings and pipes placed inside of tanks shall be of brass or other non-corroding material. Underground piping shall be of Extra Heavy Cast Iron Corporation pipe with bell and spriget or mechanical joints. Sprinkler piping passing through floors (other than floors in public halls) of concrete or waterproof construction, shall have properly designed substantial thimbles or sleeves projecting three to six inches above the floor to prevent possible floor leakage. The space between the pipe and sleeve should be caulked with oakum or equivalent material.

The Department shall act upon the application either by accepting the application or by notifying the applicant of deficiency in accordance with subdivision c of this section promptly but not later than 60 days after the date of receipt of the application, except that on or before such 60th day, the Commissioner may on good cause shown and upon notification to the applicant, extend such time for an additional 45 days. If the Department fails to act upon the application within such 60-day period or, where applicable, within such further 45-day period, the application shall be deemed accepted.

(b) The Department shall accept applications complying with the provisions of these rules and other applicable law. An OAC registration number shall be issued to the applicant of each accepted registration application. Where the application is for the renewal of an existing registration, the applicant shall be notified of such acceptance.

(c) The Department may reject an application for registration or for the renewal of registration if it finds that the application, including the accompanying listing of sign inventory required by 1 RCNY § 49-15, is not complete and accurate or all required documents have not been submitted with the application.

*§ 49-13 Term and Fees.* ::


(a) The term of the registration shall be for two years commencing on the date of issuance of an OAC registration number. The fee for the initial registration shall be $1,500 per applicant, plus $125 for each: sign; sign structure vacant of signage; and tax lot vacant of both signage and sign structures, listed in the sign inventory. The biennial registration renewal fee shall be $750 per applicant, plus $50 for each: sign; sign structure vacant of signage; and tax lot vacant of both signage and sign structures, listed in the sign inventory. The fee per material change shall be $25.

(b) A registration renewal application shall be filed no sooner than 90 or later than 60 days prior to the expiration date of the current term of the registration. Notwithstanding the renewal fee set forth in subdivision (a), where a registration renewal application is submitted later than 60 days before the expiration of the current term of the registration, the renewal fee shall be $1,500 per applicant OAC, plus $125 for each: sign; sign structure vacant of signage; and tax lot vacant of both signage and sign structures, listed in the sign inventory. A registration renewal application may not be submitted after the expiration of the current term of the registration. Nothing in this section shall prohibit an OAC with an expired registration from filing a new application for registration, subject to the filing requirements and fees of an initial registration application.






*§ 49-14 Acceptable Type of Security.* ::


(a) An applicant shall maintain security in the form of a letter of credit from an issuing bank or other security acceptable to the Department for all signs included in its inventory. Proof of such security must be filed with the Department with the initial application for registration and with all registration renewal applications. OACs may post one letter of credit or other security acceptable to the Department with respect to all affiliates or separate security for each affiliated OAC. The maximum number of letters of credit or other security acceptable to the Department shall not exceed the total number of signs in the inventory. The security must be in full force and effect from and after the date of registration. When a letter of credit or other security acceptable to the Department expires, is cancelled, is not renewed or for any reason becomes unenforceable, it shall be replaced forthwith and notice of such replacement shall be filed with the Department within 30 days thereafter. The bank shall be required to notify the Department promptly in the event of cancellation, failure to renew or other event that would render the security unavailable to the Department.

(b) The amount of security shall be $25,000 for the first 20 signs in the sign inventory, plus $10,000 for each additional 20 signs, or part thereof.

(c) Replenishment. The Department shall draw upon the security in accordance with applicable law.

Evidence thereof shall be submitted to the Department within 30 days.






*§ 49-15 Sign Inventory to be Submitted with Registration Application.* ::


(a) In addition to the information and documentation required by 1 RCNY § 49-12(a), an applicant shall submit, pursuant to § 26-261 of the Administrative Code, a sign inventory that shall include all signs, sign structures and sign locations located (1) within a distance of 900 linear feet from and within view of an arterial highway; or (2) within 200 linear feet from and within view of a public park of one-half acre or more. Such sign inventory shall be filed together with the registration application and each renewal registration application. The sign inventory submitted in connection with the renewal registration application shall include all material changes since the last registration or renewal registration application, and shall be accompanied by a statement that identifies all material changes since such prior registration. A registration application or renewal application submitted without such sign inventory or statement shall not be considered complete and may be rejected in accordance with subdivision (c) of 1 RCNY § 49-12.

(b) A sign inventory submitted by a responsible affiliate on behalf of:

   (1) an affiliated OAC, in accordance with subdivision (a)(2) of 1 RCNY § 49-12, shall include all signs, sign structures and sign locations under the shared control of such responsible affiliate and affiliated OAC; or,

   (2) every affiliated OAC, in accordance with subdivision (a)(3) of 1 RCNY § 49-12, shall include all signs, sign structures and sign locations under the control of such responsible affiliate and every affiliated OAC.

(c) The sign inventory shall be accompanied by a signed statement of a responsible officer of the OAC or, if applicable, the responsible affiliate, stating that the listing of its inventory is a complete listing of all signs, sign structures and sign locations under its control, subject to § 26-261 of the Administrative Code.

(d) The sign inventory shall be submitted on forms to be prescribed by the Department and shall include the information specified on such forms for each sign, sign structure and sign location including, but not limited to, the following:

   (1) For each sign, sign structure and sign location, the public park and/or arterial highway to which it is proximate pursuant to 1 RCNY § 49-15(a) shall be identified, and its distance in feet from such public park or arterial highway shall be listed. Such distance shall be calculated as the length of a horizontal plane extending between a vertical plane reflecting the edge of the sign, sign structure or sign location closest to the park or arterial highway and a vertical plane reflecting the portion of the park or highway closest to the sign, sign structure or sign location. Where a sign location is vacant of buildings or other structures to support signage, the measurement shall be from the edge of its tax lot closest to the public park and/or arterial highway.

   (2) The block and lot numbers and the address, if one exists, for the premises of each sign, sign structure and sign location.

   (3) The size of each sign and sign structure described in linear feet and inches.

   (4) The height in feet and inches of the highest portion of each sign and sign structure above the curb level.

   (5) Each sign shall be identified as either "advertising" or "non-advertising." To the extent a sign is a non-conforming sign, it must further be identified as "non-conforming advertising" or "non-conforming non-advertising." A sign identified as "non-conforming advertising" or "non-conforming non-advertising" shall be submitted to the Department for confirmation of its non-conforming status, pursuant to 1 RCNY § 49-16.

   (6) For each accessory sign, the name and mailing address of the business to which the sign directs attention, the nature of such business and the square footage of the floor space occupied by such business on the zoning lot.

   (7) The name and address of all parties with an interest in the premises where each sign, sign structure and sign location is situated.

   (8) The name and address of all parties with an interest in the sign or sign structure.

   (9) A diagram, labeled with the information required by (1), (2) and (3) above, eight and one-half by eleven inches in size, that shows the position of the sign, sign structure or sign location on the lot with the distance in feet to the proximate highway or park.

   (10) Digitized and printed eight inch by ten inch color photographs, clearly showing a front view and, if practicable, a rear view of the entire sign and sign structure and the building or other structure to which the sign or sign structure is attached.

   (11) The work permit for the erection, installation, or most recent alteration of the sign or sign structure. To the extent such document is unavailable, the Department may accept a statement of diligent search.

   (12) For each conforming sign, the name and license number of the master or special sign hanger who hung or erected each sign.

   (13) Whether the sign is illuminated and if so whether such illumination is indirect as such term is defined in § 12-10 of the Zoning Resolution. If the sign is illuminated, the sign inventory shall include the permit number assigned by the Electrical Division of the Department for the associated power connection and if applicable, the illuminated sign permit number.

   (14) Where a sign inventory is submitted on behalf of affiliated OACs, the legal name of the OAC that markets or manages each sign, sign structure or sign location and the legal name of the OAC with an ownership interest in each such sign, sign structure or sign location, if different, shall be identified.

   (15) With respect to each sign that has been identified in the sign inventory as a non-conforming sign, the following additional information shall be included with the registration application:

      a. The Zoning Resolution section that establishes the sign as a non-conforming sign.

      b. Evidence that the non-conforming sign existed and the size of the sign that existed as of the relevant date set forth in the Zoning Resolution to establish its lawful status. Acceptable evidence may include permits, sign-offs of applications after completion, photographs and leases demonstrating that the non-conforming use existed prior to the relevant date. Affidavits, Department cashier's receipts and permit applications, without other supporting documentation, are not sufficient to establish the non-conforming status of a sign. The submitted evidence must specifically establish the non-conforming aspect of the sign. For example, where evidence is submitted to establish that a sign is a non-conforming advertising sign, proof that the sign was erected, but that does not establish that it was advertising, will not be sufficient.

      c. Affidavit signed by the registered architect or professional engineer, that he or she reasonably believes the sign to be non-conforming based on the evidence submitted.

         (1) A responsible officer of the OAC shall co-sign the affidavit, that he or she reasonably believes the sign to be non-conforming based on the evidence submitted, and that to the best of his or her knowledge there has not been any discontinuance of the non-conforming use for two or more years.

(e) Except as to non-conforming signs, the sign inventory shall be accompanied by a certification by a registered architect or licensed professional engineer, co-signed by a responsible officer of the OAC, that he or she has personal knowledge that the signs in the sign inventory are in compliance with the Zoning Resolution.

(f) The Department shall issue to each sign, or if vacant of signage, each sign structure and sign location listed in a sign inventory of a registered OAC, a "sign identification number."

(g) The Department's acceptance of an application for registration or for the renewal of registration, and the issuance of an OAC registration number to an applicant or a sign identification number for any sign, sign structure or sign location in the sign inventory, shall not constitute a decision or determination by the Department that a sign or sign structure is lawful under the Zoning Resolution or that a sign may lawfully be erected at the sign location.

(h) An OAC shall amend its sign inventory to reflect material changes in its portfolio of signs. The amendment shall be made within 30 days after such change.

(i) The applicant shall provide a list of signs believed to be exempt from registration and not subject to Department jurisdiction and located (1) within a distance of 900 linear feet from and within view of an arterial highway; or (2) within 200 linear feet from and within view of a public park of one-half acre or more.






*§ 49-16 Non-Conforming Signs.* ::


(a) With respect to each sign identified in the sign inventory as non-conforming, the registered architect or professional engineer shall request confirmation of its non-conforming status from the Department based on the evidence submitted in the registration application. The Department shall review the evidence submitted and accept or deny the request within a reasonable period of time. A sign that has been identified as non-conforming on the initial registration application may remain erected unless and until the Department has issued a determination that it is not non-conforming. The registration of the OAC and remaining sign inventory shall continue unimpeded while such a determination is pending.

(b) The Department shall maintain a list of all signs that it accepts as non-conforming.

(c) The Department may withdraw its acceptance of a non-conforming sign upon discovering evidence that the sign was improperly considered, or should no longer be considered, a non-conforming sign, and upon such withdrawal and after notice to the OAC, the sign must be removed pursuant to the Zoning Resolution.






*§ 49-17 Information Required on Signs.* ::


On and after the 90th day after the approval of the OAC registration, all signs included in an OAC's inventory shall have posted thereon the name of the OAC to which it is registered, the OAC registration number and, unless a permit is not required, the permit identification number for the installation, alteration or erection of such sign and, if applicable, for the maintenance of such sign. All required information shall contrast with the background and be visible from the arterial highway and/or public park.

   (1) Rope Inspection.

      (i) Frequent Inspection.

         (A) All ropes in continuous service shall be visually inspected once every working day. A visual inspection shall consist of observation of all rope that can reasonably be expected to be in use during the day's operation. This visual inspection shall be directed towards discovering gross damage that may be an immediate hazard, including the following:

            1. Distortion of the rope such as kinking, crushing, unstranding, birdcaging, main strand displacement, or core protrusion. Loss of rope diameter in a short rope length or unevenness of outer strands should provide evidence that the rope or ropes must be replaced.

            2. General corrosion

            3. Broken or cut strands

            4. Number, distribution and type of visible broken wires (See subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (m) of this section for further guidance)

         (B) Care shall be taken when inspecting sections of rapid deterioration such as flange points, crossover points, and repetitive pickup points.

         (C) Care shall be taken when inspecting the following types of rope:

            1. Rotation-resistant rope.

            2. Boom hoist rope.

      (ii) Periodic Inspection.

         (A) There shall be periodic inspections performed at least annually. The inspection frequency shall be determined by a qualified person and shall be based on such factors as expected rope life as determined by experience on the particular installation or similar installations, severity of the environment, percentage of capacity lifts, frequency rates of operation, and exposure to shock loads. Inspections need not be at equal calendar intervals and should be more frequent as the rope approaches the end of its useful life.

         (B) In the event a periodic inspection is not feasible within a 12-month period due to existing set-up and configuration of the equipment or due to site conditions, such periodic inspection shall be performed as soon as it becomes feasible but no longer than an additional 6 months for running ropes and, for standing ropes, at the time of disassembly. Written notification and approval of the commissioner must be obtained prior to extending the use of the rope beyond the 12-month inspection period.

         (C) Periodic inspections shall be performed by a qualified person. This inspection shall cover the entire length of rope. Only the surface wires of the rope shall be inspected. Any deterioration resulting in an appreciable loss of original strength shall be noted and determination made as to whether further use of the rope would constitute a hazard. The periodic inspection shall include examination of the following:

            1. Points listed in clause (A) of subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (m) of this section.

            2. Reduction of rope diameter below nominal diameter due to loss of core support, internal or external corrosion, or wear of outside wires.

            3. Severely corroded or broken wires at end connections.

            4. Severely corroded, cracked bent, worn or improperly applied end connections.

         (D) Care shall be taken when inspecting sections of rapid deterioration, such as the following:

            1. Sections in contact with saddles, equalizer sheaves, or other sheaves where rope travel is limited.

            2. Sections of the rope at or near terminal ends where corroded or broken wires may protrude.

         (E) All rope that has been idle for a period of six months or more shall be given a periodic inspection before it is placed into service.

   (2) Rope Replacement.

      (i) When a rope reaches any one of the specified removal criteria, it may be allowed to operate to the end of the work shift, based on the judgment of a qualified person. The rope shall be replaced after that work shift, at the end of the day, or at the latest time prior to the equipment being used by the next work shift.

      (ii) Removal criteria for rope replacement shall meet manufacturer's specification or as follows:

         (A) Broken Wires:

            1. In running ropes, six randomly distributed broken wires in one lay or three broken wires in one strand in one lay.

            2. In rotation-resistant ropes, two randomly distributed broken wires in six diameters or four randomly distributed broken wires in 30 rope diameters.

            3. One outer wire broken at the point of contact with the core rope that has worked its way out of the rope structure and protrudes or loops out from the rope structure. Additional inspection of this section is required.

            4. Kinking, crushing, birdcaging, or any other damage resulting in distortion of the rope structure.

            5. Evidence of heat damage from any cause.

            6. Reductions from nominal diameter of more than the following:

               A. 1/64 in. for diameters up to and including 5/16 in.

               B. 1/32 in. for diameters up to and including ½ in.

               C. 3/64 in. for diameters up to and including 3/4 in.

               D. 1/16 in. for diameters up to and including 1 1/8 in.

               E. 3/32 in. for diameters up to and including 1 ½ in.

            7. In standing ropes, more than two broken wires in one lay in sections beyond end connections or more than one broken wire at an end connection.

      (iii) Replacement rope shall have strength rating at least as great as the original rope furnished or recommended by the crane manufacturer. Any deviation from the original size, grade, or construction shall be specified by the rope manufacturer, the crane manufacturer, or a qualified person.

      (iv) Discarded rope shall not be used for slings.

   (3) Rope Maintenance.

      (i) Rope shall be stored to prevent damage or deterioration.

      (ii) Unreeling or uncoiling of rope shall be done as recommended by the rope manufacturer and with extreme care to avoid kinking or inducing a twist.

      (iii) Before cutting a rope, seizings shall be placed on each side of the place where the rope is to be cut to prevent unlaying of the strands. On preformed rope, one seizing on each side of the cut is required. On non-preformed ropes of 7/8 inch diameter or smaller, two seizings on each side of the cut are required, and for non-preformed rope of one inch diameter or larger, three seizings on each side of the cut are required.

      (iv) During installation care shall be observed to avoid dragging of the rope in dirt or around objects which will scrape, nick, crush, or induce sharp bends in it.

      (v) Rope should be maintained in a well lubricated condition. It is important that lubricant applied as part of a maintenance program shall be compatible with the original lubricant and to this end the rope manufacturer should be consulted. Those sections of rope which are located over sheaves or otherwise hidden during inspection and maintenance procedures require special attention when lubricating rope. The object of rope lubrication is to reduce internal friction and to prevent corrosion. Periodic field lubrication is particularly important for non-rotating rope.

*§ 3606-01 Alteration Applications; Determinations of Market Value and Substantial Improvement.* ::


(a) Scope. This rule provides application submission requirements for alterations to structures located in areas of special flood hazard, provides the method for determining the market value of a structure, and provides the method for determining whether repairs, reconstructions, rehabilitations, additions or improvements constitute a substantial improvement.

(b) References. See Section BC G201.2 (definitions of market value of structure, substantial damage, and substantial improvement) and § 28-104.7.11.

(c) Applicant's statement. Applicants shall include in every alteration application the statement: "Work proposed in this application (is/is not) included in a substantial improvement as defined by Section BC G201.2 and 1 RCNY § 3606-01."

(d) Calculation of market value. To determine the market value of a structure, the applicant shall use either of the two calculation methods below:

   (1) Assessment roll option. Applicants shall utilize dollar amounts provided by the Department of Finance's most recent "Final Assessment Roll" by multiplying the total market value by the ratio (market value of structure to total market value):

 

 


.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - 
      - Market Value of Structure

or, at the option of the owner, or where the assessment roll method would not reflect the market value of structure because more than one building occupies a single tax lot,

   (2) Appraisal option. Applicants shall utilize dollar amounts obtained from an appraisal performed by a New York State licensed Real Estate Appraiser and performed within one year of the filing of the alteration application:

 

 


.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Market Value of Structure 
      - = 
      - Appraised Market Value (Land and Structure) 
      - = 
      - Appraised Market Value (Land) 
~



 

(e) Calculation of cost. To determine the cost of repairs, reconstructions, rehabilitations, additions or improvements of a building or structure, the applicant shall add together:

   (1) The costs for the given application, regardless of the time it takes to complete the work, plus

   (2) The cost of all other work to be performed during the same period, including work filed under separate application(s) and including any minor alterations and ordinary repairs.

(f) Determination of substantial improvement. Work shall be deemed a substantial improvement if the cost as calculated in paragraph (e) equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of structure as calculated in paragraph (d). A substantial improvement shall also include work performed to a structure that has sustained substantial damage, as such term is defined in Section BC G201.2. In determining whether a structure has sustained substantial damage, the market value shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this rule.

(g) Application for construction document approval. For an alteration that is not a substantial improvement with a cost exceeding the greater of (1) $40,000 or (2) 25% of the market value of the structure as calculated in subdivision (d) of this section, the applicant shall include calculations of the market value of the structure and costs as outlined in this rule, and shall include any relevant backup documentation including either the online printout of the Department of Finance Final Assessment Roll or a copy of the real estate appraisal.

(h) Examples of calculation of market value. The Assessment Information for the following examples is based on information from the Final Assessment Roll as provided by the Department of Finance.

   (1) Example 1; Actual A/V. For the purposes of this example, the assessed values for both the land and the total for the property are indicated as follows:

*§ 3606-02 Letters of map change.* ::


(a) Scope. This section establishes procedures for processing letters of map change, including Letters of Map Amendment and Letters of Map Revision based on Fill.

(b) References. See §§ BC G102.3, G106.5, and G201.2 (definitions of letter of map amendment (LOMA) and letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F)) and § 28-104.7.11.

(c) Letters of Map Amendment (LOMAs). Where the FEMA FIRMs 360497 indicate that a tax lot or structure is located within an area of special flood hazard, but the owner has obtained an approved LOMA from FEMA removing such tax lot or structure from areas of special flood hazard, the applicant shall nonetheless indicate on the application for construction document approval that the work is located within an area of special flood hazard. However, the work need not conform to the requirements of Appendix G of the Building Code provided (i) the applicant submits the approved LOMA with the application for construction document approval and (ii) the proposed work does not alter the grades on the site to be lower than those elevations specified in the LOMA. The examiner shall waive any required items relating to flood zones. Certificates of occupancy shall comply with Section BC G106.5.

(d) Letters of Map Revisions based on Fill (LOMR-Fs). The following procedures shall be followed where the owner requests that the Department sign a FEMA "Community Acknowledgment Form" in support of an application to FEMA for a LOMR-F (see 44 C.F.R. § 65.5). In no case shall fill be placed so as to raise the level of grade higher than curb level within a required yard or rear yard equivalent (see Zoning Resolution §§ 23-42, 33-22, and 43-22). The applicant shall undertake the following steps in the following order:

   (1) Submit application for construction document approval. Work to re-grade a site in an A-Zone in order to remove land from an area of special flood hazard shall be performed pursuant to a work permit issued by the Department. Such work shall be allowed as either a separate earthwork application or as part of a new building or alteration application. The application for construction document approval shall include (i) through (v) below:

      (i) The check-off in the box on the application that the work is located in an area of special flood hazard;

      (ii) An "Initial Survey" of existing conditions showing 1'-0" contour lines;

      (iii) No fewer than three sections traversing the entire parcel showing the base flood elevation, any proposed structures (including elevation of lowest floor), required yards and rear yard equivalents, levels of existing natural grade, levels of grade to be removed, final levels of compacted fill, and final levels of uncompacted topsoil. Additional sections shall be required when necessary to adequately depict that the work proposed complies with the code. All levels shall be indicated in NGVD with borough datum in parentheses;

      (iv) An "Initial LOMR-F Flood Zone Certification" by the registered design professional who is the applicant, stating:

         "In accordance with FEMA's Technical Bulletin 10-01 and in accordance with accepted professional practice, I, ________, certify that the design for the aforementioned development is reasonably safe from flooding and that the design of the development will not increase the risk of flooding to surrounding areas. Additionally, I certify that the design complies with the requirements of Appendix G of the Building Code, and that the level of compacted fill adjacent to all structures in the development, exclusive of uncompacted topsoil, is proposed to be at or above the base flood elevation. Further, I certify that no fill is proposed to be placed in the regulatory floodway or in an area designated as a V-Zone. Further I certify that all applicable Federal, State, and local laws shall be complied with, and all Federal, State, and local permits required for the proposed work have been obtained and submitted into the folder for this job" and

      (v) Identification of special inspection for fill placement and of evaluation of in-place density in accordance with Sections BC 1704.7.2 and 1704.7.3 (to be certified prior to sign-off). Compaction standards shall be as referenced in FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01.

   (2) Obtain approval of construction documents.

   (3) Submit application to FEMA for Conditional LOMR-F (CLOMR-F) (optional). While the CLOMR-F is an optional step, it provides preconstruction assurance that FEMA will approve the Final LOMR-F if constructed in accordance with the approved plans. At any time after construction document approval, the applicant may present to the Borough Commissioner for the Borough Commissioner's review and signature a FEMA "Community Acknowledgement Form" (which shall indicate "Conditional LOMR-F" in the "Community Comments" section), along with the approved construction documents. The owner may submit this signed Community Acknowledgement Form to FEMA. If the owner elects not to undertake the actions specified in this paragraph three, the owner must nonetheless follow the procedures and take the actions specified in paragraphs four through eight of this subdivision, however, in such case, there will be no preconstruction assurance that FEMA will ultimately approve the Final LOMR-F.

   (4) Obtain work permit.

   (5) Complete all grading, fill, and foundation work.

   (6) Present Community Acknowledgement Form to Borough Commissioner. After the completion of all grading, fill and foundation work, the applicant shall present to the Borough Commissioner for review and signature a FEMA Community Acknowledgement Form, along with the approved plans and following list of additional required items:

      (i) A "Final Survey" of completed conditions showing 1'-0" contour lines;

      (ii) Certification of completion for the special inspections for fill placement and of evaluation of in-place density. Compaction standards shall be as referenced in FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01; and

      (iii) A "Final LOMR-F Flood Zone Certification" by the registered architect or professional engineer who is the applicant on the PW-1, stating:

"In accordance with FEMA's Technical Bulletin 10-01 and in accordance with accepted professional practice, I, __________________________ , certify that all grading, fill and foundation work is complete, that the design for and construction of the aforementioned development is reasonably safe from flooding and that the design for and construction of the development will not increase the risk of flooding to surrounding areas. I have thoroughly reviewed the annexed "Initial Survey", "Final Survey" and the special inspection reports for fill placement and evaluation of in-place density. Further, I certify that all the work complies with the requirements of Appendix G of the Building Code, and that the level of compacted fill adjacent to all structures in the development, exclusive of uncompacted topsoil, is at or above the base flood elevation. Additionally, I certify that no fill has been placed in the regulatory floodway or in a designated V-Zone. Further, I certify that all applicable Federal, State, and local laws have been complied with, and all Federal, State, and local permits required for the work have been obtained and submitted into the folder for this job".

   (7) Apply to FEMA for Final LOMR-F. After the Borough Commissioner signs the Community Acknowledgement Form, the owner shall submit such signed form to FEMA.

   (8) Submit to the Department the approved LOMR-F and either a signed elevation certificate or dry floodproofing certificate as required pursuant to Section BC G 105.3. No certificate of occupancy or other final signoff shall be issued by the Department unless and until the applicant submits to the Department the Final LOMR-F approved by FEMA and either a signed elevation certificate or dry floodproofing certificate, and until all documents and submissions required by this rule are microfilmed into the permanent records of the Department. Certificates of occupancy shall comply with Section BC G 106.5.

There may be a means located in the car for manually silencing the audible signal, after the signal has been active for at least 5 seconds.

   The signal shall be automatically reactivated when the doors open.

The car shall remain under control of the operator until removed from hospital service. An elevator on Firefighters' Emergency Operation or Occupant Evacuation Operation shall not be placed on hospital service.

Delete and revise Section 2.27.6 to read as follows:

2.27.6 Firefighters' emergency operation, occupant evacuation operation: inspection operation

When an elevator that is provided with Firefighters' Emergency Operation or Occupant Evacuation Operation is on inspection operation (see 2.26.1.4 and 2.26.1.5) or when a hoistway access switch has been enabled (see 2.12.7.3.3(a)), a continuous audible signal, audible at the location where the inspection operation is activated, shall sound when a "FIRE RECALL" switch (see 2.27.3.1 and 2.27.11.1.2) is in the "ON" position or when the fire alarm initiating device (see 2.27.3.2 and 2.27.11.5) is activated to alert the operator of an emergency. The car shall remain under the control of the operator until removed from inspection operation or hoistway access operation. Inspection operation or hoistway access operation shall take precedence over Phase I Emergency Recall Operation, Phase II Emergency In-Car Operation, and Occupant Evacuation Operation.

Add new Section 2.27.11 to read as follows:

2.27.11 Occupant evacuation operation

Where elevators are provided for occupant evacuation, Occupant Evacuation Operation (OEO) shall be provided to function prior to Firefighter's Emergency Operation and shall conform to 2.27.11.1 through 2.27.11.6.

   2.27.11.6.7 When a car answers a landing call at a floor being evacuated, a car call for the elevator discharge level shall be automatically registered. The system shall accept a new landing call as soon as the doors have opened to permit loading at that floor, or sooner. If a new landing call is registered at this floor, it shall be assigned to another car, and not canceled until that car arrives. Actuation of the landing call device shall not prevent a loaded car from closing its doors and leaving the floor.

   2.27.11.6.8 While passengers are entering the car at a floor being evacuated, when the load reaches no greater than 80% of car capacity, the door reopening device(s) shall be disabled and the doors shall initiate closing at reduced kinetic energy in accordance with 2.13.4.2.1(c). If the doors stall while closing, they shall reopen fully, then close. An audible signal shall sound until the doors are closed. If the load exceeds 100% of capacity, the doors shall reopen and remain open and a voice notification and visual signal shall indicate that the car is overloaded.

   2.27.11.6.9 Once the block of floors being evacuated has been evacuated, as indicated by a 60 second period in which no landing calls are registered, one car shall park with its doors closed at the lowest floor of the block of floors ready to answer subsequent landing calls within the block of floors: the rest shall park with doors closed at the elevator designated level. A car parked at the elevator designated level shall replace the car at the lowest floor of the block that has answered a landing call.

In-Building Auxiliary Radio Communication System (ARCS). Wireless two-way radio communication enhancement system installed in buildings to propagate Fire Department wireless frequencies for the use of the Fire Department in case of an emergency.

Repeater Channel System. A repeater system utilizing channels with paired receive and transmit frequencies. When a user within the building transmits on a repeater channel, the repeater system rebroadcasts the users' signal to the DRC and all users within the building on that channel. This transmission increases the distance from which users can directly talk with each other. A user at the DRC must enable repeater channel for users to communicate.

Simplex Channel System. A simplex system utilizing channels with the same frequencies for transmit and receive. Users communicate on simplex channels radio-to-radio without going through infrastructure. However, their radios need to be within a certain distance to be picked up by one another. A simplex system allows a user at the DRC to communicate with a user on a simplex channel anywhere in the building, even though the distance between the DRC and the user would typically be prohibitive. A simplex system only extends the transmission's reach for the DRC. It does not improve coverage between individual user radios.

   (6) Minimum lot area and frontage. The minimum lot area and frontage requirements are 10,000 square feet and 100 feet respectively.

      Exception: The minimum lot area and frontage requirements do not apply to a tax lot for which title was recorded in the applicable county clerk’s office prior to August 1, 1968 where recorded dimensions of such lots are less than 10,000 square feet and/or the frontage of which is less than 100 feet, provided that only one individual private on-site sewage disposal system is permitted on each such lot.

(g) Sand column construction. All sand columns required for individual private on-site sewage disposal systems must be constructed in accordance with this section and tested in accordance with subdivision (h) of this section. Sand column construction is subject to special inspection.

   (1) Sand column dimensions. A sand column must be constructed by excavating a hole not less than three feet in width and seven feet in length. Necessary measures must be taken to prohibit surface water from entering the excavation.

   (2) Minimum depth of sand column. The excavation must continue vertically until a suitable permeable soil stratum of virgin, sandy material is reached. Where an unsatisfactory impermeable stratum is encountered, the excavation must extend through such stratum. The excavation for the proposed absorption test sand column must extend to a minimum depth of five feet into that permeable soil stratum. The minimum depth of the sand column must be 15 feet when measured from ground surface. The area at the bottom of the excavation must be a minimum of 21 square feet and confirmed by visual inspection. The depth of the permeable sand stratum and surface, trapped, or perched water must be recorded by a special inspector.

   (3) Support of excavation. The applicant may use a caisson or other means for the construction of the sand column if water enters the excavation or if a “flowing clay” stratum is penetrated.

   (4) Serpentine rock. If serpentine rock is encountered, the special inspector must document the presence of the serpentine rock, submit a laboratory test report and certify that he/she or the contractor has taken all required safety measures to protect the environment and the public health.

   (5) Backfilling the excavation. When the required depth for the sand column has been reached, as determined by the applicant, the excavation must be immediately backfilled with clean, coarse concrete sand that complies with ASTM C 33. A certified report from a testing laboratory signed by the supplier must be submitted to the department and serve to verify that the sand backfill delivered to the site meets ASTM C 33. The special inspector must witness the placement of the sand into the sand column and must verify that the material is consistent with ASTM C 33. Measures to prevent cave-ins must be taken prior to and during backfilling.

(h) Soil and groundwater testing. Soil and groundwater testing is subject to special inspection and must include a field investigation consisting of the following:

   (1) Field Testing. The following tests must be performed at the site of a proposed individual private on-site sewage disposal system:

      (i) Groundwater depth verification. Groundwater depth verification must be conducted on sand columns constructed at the site of a proposed subsurface disposal system in accordance with subdivision (g) of this section. The depth of the groundwater is determined by installing a wellpoint within the sand column at the time of sand column construction. Wellpoint construction must be in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subdivision. Groundwater verification must be conducted in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subdivision.

      (ii) Absorption test/percolation test (AT/PT). AT/ PT must be conducted on sand columns constructed at the site of a proposed subsurface disposal system in accordance with subdivision (g) of this section. The number of AT/PT must be in accordance with paragraph (4) of this subdivision. The results of the test must be documented by the special inspector on forms provided by the department.

   (2) Wellpoint construction. A pipe with a minimum diameter of 1-1/4 inches must be inserted through the sand column to serve as a wellpoint to test the groundwater level. The pipe must be driven or placed into the column to a depth of at least one foot below the bottom of the sand column with sufficient piping to extend three feet above the existing grade. The bottom four feet of the pipe must have a screen with holes of a sufficient size to admit water and exclude the surrounding sand. (See Figure 1.)

Figure 1WellPoint

   (3) Groundwater verification. The presence of accumulated water in the wellpoint pipe, indicating groundwater level, must be determined by the department representative and the special inspector using an approved probe. The special inspector shall also note the type of water table - perched, apparent, or artesian. The wellpoint must be maintained for 72 hours so that the level of water accumulation can be monitored and measured. A reading of the water level in the wellpoint must be taken 72 hours after the setting of the wellpoint and must be performed as follows:

      (i) Timing. The groundwater level in a wellpoint must be performed between March 15th and June 30th.

      (ii) High tide. The groundwater level must be determined during the time of daily high tide between March 15th and June 30th, in the following tidal areas:

         (A) On Staten Island, the areas on the Raritan Bay and Arthur Kill sides of Hylan Boulevard and Arthur Kill Road.

         (B) In all other locations, if the individual private onsite sewage disposal system is to be constructed within 1,000 feet of the shoreline or tidal wetland line, whichever is closest to such systems. This subparagraph applies only to those systems where the bottom of the sand column is within three feet of mean sea level.

      (iii) Acceptable sand column. If no water is found in the wellpoint after 72 hours have elapsed, the sand column is deemed a dry hole and the site is acceptable for installation of a seepage pit system.

      (iv) Additional check if water is found. If water is found in the wellpoint after 72 hours have elapsed and the water level is no higher than five feet below the impervious soil layer, or three feet below the impervious soil layer in tidal areas, as specified in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (3) of this subdivision, the department representative must check again for the presence of water after a gallon of water is poured down the wellpoint.

         (A) If the department representative observes the complete exit of the gallon of water from the wellpoint within 30 minutes, then the sand column is considered a dry hole, and the site is acceptable for installation of a seepage pit system.

         (B) If the gallon of water does not exit the wellpoint within 30 minutes, the applicant must remove, examine, clean and reset the wellpoint in the sand column and perform the groundwater verification again in accordance with this subdivision.

      (v) Unacceptable site. If water is found in the wellpoint, following resetting, a seepage pit system is not appropriate for the site.

      (vi) Invalid sand column. If a reading cannot be taken for any reason, the sand column is invalid and cannot be used for further testing.

   (4) Number of AT/PT for seepage pit and sand field systems. The number of AT/PT must be as specified in subparagraphs (i) and (ii), below. The commissioner may require additional AT/PT to confirm the suitability of subsurface conditions.

      (i) Seepage pit type system with one sand column. Where a seepage pit- type system is designed with one sand column a minimum of one AT/PT must be conducted within the sand column. Sand columns must be constructed in accordance with subdivision (g) of this section. AT/PT must be conducted in accordance with paragraph (5) of this subdivision.

      (ii) Seepage pit and sand filter type systems with two sand columns. Where a system is proposed and two sand columns are required per subdivision (g) of this section each sand column is subject to the AT/ PT described in paragraph (5) of this subdivision. The requirements to install a wellpoint set forth in paragraph (2) of this subdivision are not applicable to the second sand column.

         Exception: In those cases where the second sand column is within 25 feet of the first sand column, AT/ PT testing is not required subject to the submission by the applicant of the following:

         (A) Proof that satisfactory excavation, wellpoint and AT/PT were performed on sand column 1 and witnessed by the department; and

         (B) Data prepared by a special inspector confirming compliant construction of the second sand column.

      (iii) Seepage pit and sand filter type systems with sand column depth of 35 feet or deeper. Where a system is proposed with one or more sand columns having a depth of 35 feet or deeper, all required AT/ PT(s) must be performed on two consecutive days.

   (5) AT/PT on sand column backfill material. Where a sand column is constructed in accordance with subdivision (g) of this section, an AT/PT must be performed on the clean sand backfill. An acceptable sand column must pass a four-hour AT/PT following a pre-soak performed onsite in the following manner:

      (i) Timing; supervision; forms. The AT/PT may be performed any time during the year provided the air temperature is above freezing. The AT/PT must be performed under the supervision of a department employee as well as subject to continuous special inspection. The result of the AT/PT must be filed on forms provided by the department, stating the suitability of the site and the capacity of the subsoil for the proposed use.

      (ii) Scheduling. At the time of scheduling an AT/PT, the registered design professional must inform the department of the date and time the pre-soak will start, the date and time that the saturation point will be reached, and the start of the four-hour test.

      (iii) AT/PT procedure. The pre-soak and four-hour test must be performed in the following manner:

         (A) The sand column must be pre-soaked prior to the scheduled AT/PT. The required volume of water for the pre-soak is 80 gallons for every foot of dry depth, as determined using a water level sensor or other analogous device. Where the base of the sand column exceeds 21 square feet, the volume must be increased proportionately.

         (B) The pre-soak must be conducted by using a one-inch diameter or larger hose. Where the hose is connected to a potable water supply, a certified reduced pressure zone (RPZ) backflow preventer must be used.

         (C) Following the pre-soak, the four-hour AT/PT must absorb twice the daily flow rate (Q) as determined by Table 2. In no case may the absorption rate be less than 1.5 gallons per minute (GPM).The rate of water flow into the sand column during the AT/ PT must be recorded using a calibrated water meter with all necessary control valves. Where connected to a potable water supply, a certified reduced pressure zone backflow preventer must be used.

a   For one and two-family properties, minimum daily flow rate (Q) is based on the efficiency of water fixtures employed multiplied by the number of bedrooms:

   Water saving fixtures  1.6 GPF max. water closets and 3.0 GPM max. faucets/showerheads: 110 GPD per bedroom.

   Standard fixtures  3.5 GPF max. water closets and 3.0 GPM max. faucets/showerheads: 130 GPD per bedroom.

   Standard fixtures  3.5+ GPF max. water closets and 3.0+ GPM max. faucets/showerheads: 150 GPD per bedroom.

b   Where daily flow rate (Q) differs from values shown, round up to the next value indicated in the table.

         (D) Readings must be observed and recorded by the special inspector at intervals of 60 minutes or less for the duration of the test. Records of readings must be maintained on site during testing. In no case may the absorption rate be less than 1.5 gallons per minute (GPM). The test must be terminated if there is an absorption rate which does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (iii) at any time during the four-hour test. In such case, the sand column is deemed unacceptable.

      (iv) AT/PT failure and retesting. If the sand column fails the AT/PT, the registered design professional has the option to:

         (A) Clean out the sand column to any depth, pre-soak and re-test, or

         (B) Construct a second sand column, pre-soak and perform the AT/PT on the newly constructed sand column. The original sand column must be entirely backfilled.

      The retest must be performed on the following day. If a lot fails the AT/PT twice, the lot is considered unbuildable.

   (6) AT/PT termination. The AT/PT must be terminated if any of the following conditions occur:

      (i) Water flow stops. If the water flow stops for any reason for 15 minutes in a test that has no sign of failure.

      (ii) Termination of test. If the special inspector terminates the test for any reason before reaching 50% of the saturation.

      (iii) Malfunctions. If the meter or the water supply system malfunctions and cannot be repaired within 15 minutes in a test that has no sign of failure.

      (iv) Failure to protect potable water. If the special inspector does not use the required properly tested and certified reduced pressure zone backflow preventer where connection is made to a potable water system.

      (v) Unforeseen circumstances. If the AT/PT is impossible to complete for any unforeseen circumstance.

   (7) AT/PT failure criteria. The AT/PT is deemed a failure if any of the following conditions occurs:

      (i) Average rate. If the average rate for any given hour falls below 1.5 GPM while maintaining a steady water puddle on the top of the hole during the four-hour test.

      (ii) Percolation rate. If the percolation rate is faster than one minute per inch unless the site is modified by blending with a less permeable soil to reduce the infiltration rate throughout the area to be used.

      (iii) Overflow or leakage. If the water consistently overflows or leaks outside the perimeter of the hole during pre-soak or during the four-hour AT/PT.

      (iv) Vertical flow. If the water penetrates the clay perimeter of the hole instead of flowing vertically into the sand column at any time during the four-hour AT/ PT.

      (v) Interruption of test. If the registered design professional or his/her representative manipulates the water flow rate or stops the water at any time during a test.

(i) Design and construction standards for all types of systems. Systems must be designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of this section.

   (1) Piping. All piping associated with the installation of individual private on-site sewage disposal systems must be shown on construction documents. In addition, the following requirements apply:

      (i) House drain connection slope. The slope of a house drain connection to a septic tank must not be less than 1/4” per foot and must be extra heavy cast iron pipe, not less than four inches in diameter.

      (ii) Outlet pipe slope. The slope of an outlet pipe from a septic tank to an absorption facility or distribution box must not be less than 1/8” per foot and must be constructed of plastic, extra strength vitrified clay or other noncorrosive material. The use of cast iron, ductile iron or concrete pipe is prohibited.

      (iii) Bends and venting. The piping must be laid in accordance with Section PC 306. The house drain must have no more than two bends. Any bend 45 degrees or greater must be equipped with a cleanout and a properly fitted plug. The house connection must allow for venting of gases from the septic tank. Cleanouts must be provided in accordance with Section PC 708.

   (2) Septic tanks. The following requirements apply to all septic tanks unless otherwise specified:

      (i) Design criteria. The following requirements apply to all septic tanks regardless of material:

         (A) Driveways or other facilities may not be constructed above tanks unless the tank is specially designed and reinforced to safely carry the load imposed.

         (B) All septic tanks must be enclosed.

         (C) Septic tank capacities for one and two-family properties must be based upon the number of household bedrooms. Table 3 specifies minimum tank capacities and minimum liquid surface areas. For the purpose of calculating the required capacity of a tank, a finished attic is considered an additional bedroom.

Note: Tank size requirements for more than 6 bedrooms is calculated by adding 250 gallons and 7 square feet of surface area for each additional bedroom. A garbage grinder shall be considered equivalent to an additional bedroom for determining tank size.

         (D) Septic tank capacities for sites other than one and two-family homes must be sized based on the daily flow rate (Q) of the proposed occupancy. Table B-3 of the New York State Design Standards for Intermediate Sized Wastewater Treatment Systems specifies the typical per-unit hydraulic loading rates for various occupancies and uses. When an establishment includes several different types of uses from the table, each use must be computed separately and the daily flow rate (Q) is the sum of the individual rates. The minimum effective tank capacity must be calculated in accordance with Table D-2 of the New York State Design Standards for Intermediate Sized Wastewater Treatment Systems, as follows:

Minimum Effective Tank Capacity (gal) = 1.5 x Q

Where a non-residential facility has a significant delivery period, it may be necessary to increase tank size and guidance is provided in section D.6 of the New York State Design Standards for Intermediate Sized Wastewater Treatment Systems. Additionally, no tank may have a capacity less than 1,000 gallons.

         (E) An additional 250 gallons of capacity and seven square feet of surface area is required when a garbage grinder is to be installed at the time of construction or in the future. A gas deflection baffle or other acceptable outlet modification, and a dual compartment tank or two tanks in series must also be provided.

         (F) A tank must contain a minimum depth of 30 inches for liquid. The maximum depth for determining the allowable capacity of a tank is 60 inches. A tank deeper than 60 inches may provide extra sludge storage, but no credit may be given toward tank capacity when such a tank is used.

         (G) The minimum distance between the inlet and the outlet in a tank must be six feet. A tank must meet the minimum surface area requirement for the tank capacity specified in Table 3. The effective length of a rectangular tank must not be less than two nor greater than four times the effective width.

         (H) Installed tanks must be able to support at least 300 pounds per square foot (psf).

         (I) A tank must have a top opening with a minimum of 20 inches in the shortest dimension to permit cleaning and maintenance.

         (J) A tank must have inlet and outlet baffles or sanitary tees or other devices to prevent the passage of floating solids and to minimize the disturbance of settled sludge and floating scum by sewage entering and leaving the tank. An outlet design, such as a gas deflection baffle, is required in a tank. An inlet and outlet baffle must extend a minimum of 12 inches and 14 inches, respectively, below the liquid level in a tank with a liquid depth of less than 40 inches, and 16 and 18 inches respectively, in a tank with a liquid depth of 40 inches or greater. The distance between an outlet baffle and the outlet must not exceed six inches. A baffle must be constructed of durable material not subject to corrosion, decay or cracking.

         (K) There must be a minimum of one-inch clearance between the underside of the top of a tank and the top of all baffles, partitions and/or tees to permit venting of tank gases through the building stack. Multi-chamber and multi-tank systems must also be designed to permit the venting of tank gases.

         (L) There must be a minimum drop in elevation of two inches between the inverts of the inlet and outlet pipes.

      (ii) Construction. The following requirements apply to all septic tanks regardless of material:

In addition to meeting the requirements of subparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision, dual-compartment tanks must be designed as follows:

         (A) The first compartment (inlet side) must account for 60-75% of the required total design volume.

         (B) The baffle separating the compartments must extend from the bottom of the tank to at least six inches above the invert of the outlet pipe.

         (C) Compartments must be connected by a four-inch vertical slot at least 18 inches in width, a six-inch elbow, or two four-inch elbows located at a distance below the liquid level equal to 1/3 the distance between the invert of the outlet and the bottom of the tank. At least one access cover must be provided into each compartment.

         (D) For the purposes of Table 3, the capacity and surface area must be based upon the total capacity and surface areas of both compartments.

      (iv) Tanks in series. In addition to meeting the requirements of subparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision, tanks in series must be designed as follows:

         (A) The first tank must account for 60-75% of the required total design volume.

         (B) Tanks must be connected by a single pipe with a minimum diameter of four inches.

All walls, bottom and top must contain reinforcing to assure support for 300 psf.

         (D) The design of the concrete tank must be certified by a New York State licensed professional engineer as adequate for the expected loads. Specifications for installation and backfill must be established by the applicant.

         (E) All joints, pipe penetrations and access ports must be sealed so that the concrete tank is watertight. Joints below the liquid level must be tested for watertightness prior to backfilling. A hydrostatic air pressure or vacuum test must be performed to confirm watertightness. This test must be performed under the supervision of a special inspector.

            1. If a hydrostatic test is used, it must be run for 28 hours. A tank that shows no water loss during such time period is watertight.

            2. If a vacuum test is used, it must apply five inches of mercury vacuum for ten minutes. A concrete tank that demonstrates no detectable vacuum loss during such time period is watertight.

         (F) The walls and floor of a cast-in-place concrete tank must be poured at the same time (monolithic pour).

   (3) Associated system components.

      (i) Manholes. Manholes must comply with one of the following:

         (A) All manholes in paved areas must have a cast iron watertight frame and a cover that can be locked to prevent tampering that is flush with the finished paved surface.

         (B) All manholes in other than paved areas that are more than 12 inches below final grade must have an extension collar over each opening. Extension collars may not be brought flush with the ground surface unless the cover of the access opening can be locked to prevent tampering. If the cover of an access opening cannot be locked to prevent tampering, the extension collar must be terminated 12 inches below existing grade.

         (C) Where drop manholes are used on sloping sites with gravity distribution to reduce the velocity of flow to lower distribution lines, drop manholes must comply with the following: 1. Baffles are required at the inlet end of the manhole and approximately four inches from the inlet. 2. The inverts of all outlets in each manhole must be at the same level.

      (ii) Manhole covers. Manhole covers must comply with the following:

         (A) A septic tank must have one access opening with a manhole cover over the inlet, and one access opening with a manhole cover over the outlet of the tank as per Figures 2 and 3.

         (B) The top of the manhole cover must either be set within 12 inches of the finished grade or, where a cover is located more than 12 inches below the finished grade, an extension collar must be provided over each access opening to bring the manhole cover to a point within 12 inches of the finished grade.

         (C) The manhole cover must be installed so as to prevent unauthorized entry and must be accessible for inspection, maintenance and cleaning. No person other than a licensed master plumber or person engaged in sewer services (one who renders sewer services, including but not limited to installing, altering, repairing, cleaning and pumping sewers and septic tanks as part as one’s regular business or employment) may remove or open the cover of any tank unless otherwise authorized during an emergency by an officer or employee of a city agency.

         (D) Manhole covers must be designed for a live load of at least 300 pounds per square foot.

         (E) Concrete manhole covers, when used, must be reinforced and at least four inches thick.

         (F) An access opening with cover must be at least 20 inches square for non-concrete tanks and at least 24 inches in diameter for concrete tanks.

   (4) Seepage pit design and construction.

      (i) Design requirements. A seepage pit system must be designed in accordance with the following requirements:

         (A) Seepage pit units must have a liquid capacity (volume below inlet line) at least two times that of the septic tank.

         (B) Seepage pits must contain a sand column constructed in accordance with subdivision (h) of this section. A second sand column must be provided if the permeable stratum at the bottom of the test hole for the seepage pit is deeper than 15 feet.

         (C) Seepage pits must include an absorptive area. The required absorptive area is the interface area between the outside of the aggregate collar in the pit and the surrounding sand collar which transmits the effluent to the sand column below. As shown in Figure 4, the aggregate collar must be at least one foot in width, and the sand collar must be at least two feet in width.

         (D) The percolation rate, determined by the AT/PT on the concrete sand used in backfilling the test hole and absorption facilities, must be used to calculate the minimum required absorptive area in the seepage pit for a given sewage application rate and daily flow rate (Q) in accordance with Table 2.

         (E) In addition Table 4 applies to seepage pit designs which utilize cylindrical rings. The bottom area of the seepage pit cannot be included in calculating the required absorptive area. For those designs utilizing Table 4, the effective diameter of a seepage pit is the outside diameter of the aggregate ring surrounding the inside perforated concrete rings. Effective depth is measured from the invert of the seepage pit inlet to the floor of the seepage pit.

Absorptive Area for Cylinder = 3.14 * D * h

Absorptive Area for Rectangular Pit = (2W + L) h

h = effective depth (invert of inlet to bottom of seepage pit)

D = outside diameter in feet

W = outside width in feet

L = outside length in feet

         (F)    If more than one seepage pit of circular design is required to dissipate the effluent from a septic tank, the separation distance between the outside edges of the sand collars of the seepage pits must be 3 times the effective seepage pit dimension of the largest pit. The effective seepage pit dimension must be the distance between the opposite outer perimeters of the sand collar. For the purpose of determining separation distances, a seepage pit is permitted to contain multiple leaching rings.

         (G) For seepage pits of non-circular shapes, the separation distance between the outer edges of the sand collars of the seepage pits must be 3 times the average of the length times the width. Either separation distance must be measured as the soil, undisturbed when construction is complete, between pit excavations. For the purpose of determining separation distances, a seepage pit is permitted to contain multiple leaching rings.

   (5) Sand filter field. Where a seepage pit is not permissible because groundwater is encountered in the sand column, a sand filter field type septic system may be used. The system must contain a septic tank, sand filled columns and either a gravity system with a distribution box or a sand filter field designed to accommodate a pressure distribution pump chamber. The system must be designed and installed in accordance with the following requirements:

      (i) Testing. Testing for sand filter field systems must comply with paragraph (1) of subdivision (h) of this section.

      (ii) Sand columns. A minimum of two sand columns is required under sand filter field systems. Construction of the sand column must comply with subdivision (g) of this section.

      (iii) Septic tanks. Septic tanks must comply with the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subdivision.

      (iv) Distribution box and piping. A distribution box must precede all gravity sand filter field systems. The distribution box and related piping must comply with the following requirements:

         (A) The box must be of concrete or steel. If steel, it must be 12-gage minimum, bituminous-coated in accordance with UL 70.

         (B) The floor area of the box must be sized to allow for maximum head of sewage for equal distribution to all outlet lines.

         (C) The top of the box must be at least 9 inches above the invert of the outlet lines.

         (D) To minimize frost action and reduce the possibility of movement once installed, distribution boxes must be set on a bed of sand or pea gravel at least 12 inches thick.

         (E) A baffle at the inlet must be provided to prevent short circuiting of the flow.

         (F) The box must be high enough so that the cover is within 12 inches of the finished grade.

         (G) All outlet inverts must be set two inches below the inlet invert.

         (H) There shall be a minimum two inch clearance between the inverts of the outlets and the bottom of the box to prevent short-circuiting and reduce solids carry-over.

         (I) Lines from the distribution box to the disposal field must be not less than four inches in diameter and must be laid with tight joints on a uniform slope not less than 1/8 inch per foot.

         (J) Gravity perforated distributors must be four inches in diameter SDR 35 PVC, sloped 1/16 to 1/32 inch per foot, less than or equal to 50 feet long, and spaced three feet on center and 1-1/2 feet from sidewalls. Perforations must be 5/8 inch in diameter and placed at the 4 o’clock and 8 o’clock positions every six inches along the length of the pipe.

a   For one and two-family properties, minimum daily flow rate (Q) is based on the efficiency of water fixtures employed multiplied by the number of bedrooms:

   Water saving fixtures  1.6 GPF max. water closets and 3.0 GPM max. faucets/showerheads: 110 GPD per bedroom.

   Standard fixtures  3.5 GPF max. water closets and 3.0 GPM max. faucets/showerheads: 130 GPD per bedroom.

   Standard fixtures  3.5+ GPF max. water closets and 3.0+ GPM max. faucets/showerheads: 150 GPD per bedroom.

b   Where daily flow rate (Q) differs from values shown, round up to the next value indicated in the table.

      (viii) Driveways and paved areas. Driveways and paved areas may not be located above absorption facilities including subsurface sand filters unless the requirements listed below are met:

         (A) Lateral vent piping must be installed between each distribution lateral. A minimum spacing of 18 inches must be provided between vent piping and distribution laterals. Lateral vent pipe must be four-inch SDR 35 perforated PVC or equally acceptable material.

         (B) The lateral vent pipes must connect to a vent pipe. The vent pipe must be a minimum of four inches in diameter and must not be connected to the house vent stack.

         (C) See Figure 6 for typical sand filter field beneath paved areas.

Figure 6Typical Sand Filter Field (Beneath Paved Areas)

      (ix) Serpentine rock. Sand filter fields are required whenever serpentine rock is proposed as the medium for the ultimate disposal of the effluent. Sand columns must be dry with a minimum of four feet of filter sand above serpentine rock. Sand filter field system over serpentine rock must be designed and installed in accordance with the following requirements:

         (A) The system design must include at least six feet of vertical separation between finished grade and the serpentine rock.

         (B) Sand filter fields located above dry sand columns at locations where serpentine rock is less than six feet below finished grade must be modified to provide a minimum of four feet of sand filter both horizontally and vertically from distributor aggregate to serpentine rock.

   (6) Alternative systems. Alternative subsurface treatment systems must comply with the requirements contained in Chapter II Subchapter I Part 75 Appendix 75-A.9 of 10 NYCRR 75.

   (7) Repairs. A permit is required for repair to any system or associated components, including the repair or replacement of any type of absorption field that involves relocating or extending an absorption area to a location not previously approved, the installation of a new subsurface treatment system at the same location, or the use of an alternative system. A licensed master plumber may file a Limited Alteration Application (LAA) with the department for plumbing work consisting of in-kind repairs or like-for-like replacements. Exception. Cesspools may not be repaired. Cesspools must be replaced with an acceptable system in accordance with the requirements of this section.

   (8) Expansion of existing septic systems. Where an alteration is proposed that will result in an increase in the number of bedrooms in one- and two-family properties or the daily flow rate (Q) in all other properties, thereby increasing the load on that system, the requirements of this paragraph apply. Exception. Cesspools may not be expanded. Cesspools must be replaced with an acceptable system in accordance with the requirements of this section.

      (i) Evaluation of existing septic system. A special inspector must perform an inspection of the individual private on-site sewage disposal system to demonstrate that the existing system is functioning properly. A report of the inspection must be submitted to the department with the application for expansion of the system. The inspection must include:

         (A) Inspection of the premises to verify that there is no evidence of surface failure of the existing system;

         (B) Inspection of all piping leading from the residence to the system. If piping is damaged it must be replaced prior to testing;

         (C) Inspection of the interior of the system to verify that the system is free of structural damage and debris; and

         (D) Inspection of additional parts of the system.

      (ii) Cleaning and pumping of existing septic systems. Prior to testing the septic tank as required by subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, a septage hauler with a valid permit from the DEC must pump all sludge and debris from the septic tank and remove such contents from the site.

      (iii) Infiltration testing of existing septic systems. A test of the system must be performed by flowing a volume of water equal to the estimated daily design volume plus the estimated volume of the system, but not less than 3,000 gallons. Following this initial charge of water a continuous stream of dyed water must be pumped into the system at a rate of 1.5 gallons per minute for a period of not less than four hours. The special inspector must observe the test and verify that the system is functioning, continuously accepting water without backflow and that no dyed water is observed above ground surface. Dyed water observed breaking the ground surface is a failed test. Where applicable, the infiltration test must be performed during high tide.

      (iv) Damaged or malfunctioning septic systems. Where testing and inspection indicate that a system has been damaged or has failed the infiltration test, a permit application must be filed with the department for the repair or replacement of the system. A new infiltration test must be conducted on the repaired system to verify if expansion is feasible.

      (v) Application. A registered design professional must submit an application showing the details of the proposed expanded system. Existing portions of the individual private on-site sewage disposal system which are found to be in good working order may be incorporated into the expanded system. The expanded system must comply with the requirements of this section.

(j) Abandoned septic systems. The following requirements apply:

   (1) Abandoned existing septic systems. An individual private on-site sewage disposal system must be abandoned and a connection made to a newly constructed sanitary or combined sewer when such sewer fronts the subject property. Connection must be made within six months of the sewer being placed into service.

   (2) Waste removal and backfilling of abandoned septic systems. When an individual private on-site sewage disposal system is abandoned after a sewer connection is made, all septic tanks, dosing tanks, seepage pits, distribution boxes, cesspools and any other structure that may have held sewage or sewage solids must be pumped free of wastes. Wastes must be removed by a septage hauler licensed by the DEC. All component portions of the abandoned system must be exposed and backfilled with gravel or sand. The site of the abandoned system must be returned to a level, finished grade.

(k) Maintenance and operation. The following requirements apply:

   (1) Maintenance. The owner must maintain the septic system in good working order and must have the septic system inspected and pumped as needed.

   (2) Use. An individual private on-site sewage disposal system must be used only for the disposal of sewage.

      (i) Detrimental or dangerous materials. Ashes, cinders or rags; flammable, poisonous or explosive liquids or gases; oil, grease or any other insoluble material capable of obstructing, damaging or overloading the building drainage or sewer system, or capable of interfering with the normal operation of the sewage treatment processes, may not be deposited, by any means, into such systems.

   (3) Discharge of groundwater and storm water. Groundwater infiltration and/or storm water run-off from sources including but not limited to basement floors, footings, garages, roofs, or heating and cooling systems must not be discharged to the individual private on-site sewage disposal system and must be diverted away from the vicinity of the absorption area.

   (4) Repair of leaks. All plumbing leaks from fixtures connected to individual private on-site sewage disposal systems must be repaired promptly to prevent hydraulic overloading of the system and the development of a surface discharge.

   (5) Malfunctioning septic systems. Malfunctioning systems must be repaired immediately. A permit application must be filed with the department for the repair or replacement of the system. Conditions that constitute a malfunctioning system include but are not limited to:

      (i) Contamination. Evidence of contamination of groundwater or surface water bodies by sewage or effluent;

      (ii) Ponding. Ponding or breakout of any wastewater, sewage, septic tank effluent or any liquid from the existing on-site system onto the surface of the ground;

      (iii) Seepage. Seepage of sewage or effluent into portions of buildings below ground; or

      (iv) Sewage back-up. Back-up of sewage into the building connected to the system which is not caused by a physical blockage of the internal plumbing.

   (6) Department notice of need for special inspector. The department may issue a notice directing the owner of an individual private on-site sewage disposal system to engage a special inspector to verify the condition of the system. The special inspector must observe and document the results of dye tests or other diagnostic measures on fixtures connected to the suspected malfunctioning systems. The special inspector must furnish inspection reports to the department.

(l) Plot plans. Where a new individual private on-site sewage disposal system is installed the applicant of record must prepare a plot plan. The plot plan must contain the location of all pertinent components comprising the individual private on-site sewage disposal system and maintenance and inspection schedule. Where a drywell is installed it must be indicated on the plot plan. The plot plan must be permanently affixed to the inside wall adjacent to the fresh air outlet pipe.

(m) Restrictive declaration. Where a new individual private onsite sewage disposal system is installed the owner must file a restrictive declaration noting the existence and maintenance requirements of an individual on-site private sewage system on the property with the City Register or County Clerk, and the page number and liber number must be identified in the permit application and on the temporary and permanent certificate of occupancy. Where an individual private on-site sewage disposal system is abandoned pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (j) the restrictive declaration must be terminated in accordance with the department’s procedures.

(n) Special Inspections. Special inspections are required for the installation of individual private on-site sewage disposal systems in accordance with Table 7.

Chapter 9000: Zoning
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 9000-01 Adult Establishments.* ::


Dates of establishment and discontinuance of adult establishments, houses of worship, and schools for the purposes of §§ 32-01 and 42-01 of the zoning resolution. In determining whether an adult establishment may lawfully be established at a location pursuant to §§ 32-01 and 42-01 of the zoning resolution, the department will use the following criteria to determine the dates of establishment and discontinuance for adult establishments, houses of worship and schools located or proposed to be located within 500 feet of each other.

(a) The date of establishment of an adult establishment, house of worship, or school in existence and operating prior to August 8, 2001 shall be the date of issuance of an appropriate department permit or, if no permit was required, the date that it commenced operation, as determined by the department.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision a of this section, the date of establishment of an adult establishment, house of worship, or school shall be the date of issuance of an appropriate department permit, subject to the following qualifications:

   (1) With respect to a new building permit or alteration permit:

      (i) significant progress must be shown toward completion of the work under the permit. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term "significant progress" means the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy or, if applicable, department signoff of the work within one year of issuance of the permit, except that upon application, the commissioner or his or her designee, may extend the one year period in accordance with subdivision c of this section for a period of time not exceeding one year, and

      (ii) the use or operation for which the building is constructed or altered must commence within six months after the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy or, if applicable, within six months after a department signoff that the work has been completed, except that upon application, the commissioner or his or her designee, may extend the six month period in accordance with subdivision c of this section for a period of time not exceeding six months.

   (2) With respect to applications for permits filed solely to establish priority, where no work requiring a building permit is proposed, the use or operation for which the permit is issued must commence within two months of the issuance of such permit, except that upon application, the commissioner or his or her designee may extend such two month period in accordance with subdivision c of this section for a period of time not exceeding two months.

(c) An extension of time pursuant to subdivision b of this section may be granted where the permittee submits an application no later than 30 days prior to the expiration of the applicable time period together with satisfactory evidence that significant progress or the commencement of use or operations within the applicable time period is impracticable. The commissioner or his or her designee shall make a determination and notify the applicant in writing of his or her determination not later than 30 days after receipt of the application by the department. If the application is denied, the commissioner or his or her designee shall state the reason(s) therefor. If the commissioner or his or her designee fails to act upon the application within such 30-day period, the application shall be deemed to be granted.

(d) An adult establishment, otherwise in compliance with the zoning resolution, may be established within 500 feet of a discontinued adult establishment, house of worship or school. For the purposes of this subdivision, once established, an adult establishment, house of worship, or school shall not be deemed to be discontinued until it has ceased operation for a continuous period of one year or longer.

(e) The time periods set forth in this section for significant progress of work or for commencement of operations shall commence to run as of the effective date of this section or issuance of the permit, whichever is later.
