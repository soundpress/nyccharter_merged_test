New York City’s Charter, Code & Rules
=================================

WeGov.NYC created this accessible, searchable, mobile-friendly websites for New York City’s charter, codes and rules because New Yorker’s deserve better than `what the city offers <http://library.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/New%20York/admin/newyorkcityadministrativecode?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:newyork_ny>`_. 
This website's content was last updated: February 4th, 2020.
