*§ 4-10 Burden of Proof on Market Value and Other Facts.* ::


(a)  An assessment is presumed correct.

(b) Applicants must initially show substantial evidence sufficient to raise a valid and credible dispute regarding valuation before a hearing officer will proceed with a substantive review of an application.

(c) Applicants bear the burden to prove that the assessment is erroneous by a preponderance of the evidence.

(d) A complete application is the minimum evidence required for eligibility for a substantive review of an application. Facts specific to the property may be submitted in addition to the facts required by the prescribed forms.

(e) Applicants claiming that an assessment is excessive, unequal or misclassified must prove full market value, regardless of restrictions personal to the owner, according to the condition, ownership, and use of the property on the tax status date, January 5.

(f) In proving market value, applicants shall adhere to the three approaches to valuation recognized by the courts: sales, income, and cost.

(g) The Tax Commission shall review the assessment, not components of the underlying valuation formula. By itself, an error in the valuation methodology or calculations used to derive the assessment shall not establish an assessment error.

(h) Evidence of market value estimates of the Department of Finance or assessments of comparable properties shall not establish the market value of a property.

(i) Property for which an application for review of the assessment is filed shall be subject to interior and exterior inspection by a City employee.

(j) The hearing officer may cause the person who signed the application or any other person to appear, take such person's testimony under oath and require such person to produce for examination such books, records and documents upon which the application is based.

(k) Evidence to dispute the Department of Finance tax class ratio of assessment shall conform to Real Property Tax Law § 720(3) to be considered on a claim that an assessment is unequal. A representative or self-represented applicant shall provide notice at least ten days before a scheduled hearing that he or she expects to offer such evidence.

(l) The hearing officer shall consider and weigh the strength, credibility and persuasiveness of arguments and facts offered in support of an application, including the application, documents, photographs and maps, and sworn testimony on personal knowledge, along with arguments, records, or other evidence offered by the Department of Finance, records of the Tax Commission, or facts within the knowledge and experience of the hearing officer.






*§ 4-11 Proving Market Value.* ::


(a)  Sale of the subject property.

   (1) The price at which a property sold in a recent arm's-length transaction between a willing buyer and seller on the open market, if not shown to be abnormal, is significant evidence of the value of the property.

   (2) Applicants shall report the fact and details of any of the following transactions concerning the property under review occurring within a two-year period preceding the tax status date, January 5, and thereafter until an application is determined or an offer is accepted, whichever occurs later: any transfer of the property under review, any transfer of an ownership interest in the property, and the execution of a contract to transfer the property.

      (i) An application that fails to report the fact and details of a transaction concerning the property that occurred before filing shall be denied review.

      (ii) Failure to report a transaction concerning the property that occurs after filing an application and before determination of the application while the application is pending for determination shall result in denial of review.

      (iii) Failure to report a transaction concerning the property that occurs after a hearing and before an offer is accepted shall result in withdrawal or revocation of an offer.

   (3) Applicants shall report the fact and details of any net lease of the property under review in effect when an application is filed, when any such net lease is negotiated or executed while the application is pending for determination, or when an offer is accepted. Failure to report on a net lease shall result in denial of review or confirmation of the assessment if review preceded the execution of the net lease or the report.

   (4) Applicants shall report details about a transfer of the property under review on the form prescribed for that purpose. The details required by such form may include, but shall not be limited to, whether the sale was an arm's-length transaction between unrelated persons, whether the sale was made without economic duress, and other aspects of the consideration and circumstances of the sale.

   (5) In reporting a transfer of the property under review, applicants may be required to submit a copy of a closing statement in sufficient detail to permit identification of the principals, the total consideration paid, whether by cash or assumption of mortgages or other liabilities such as unpaid taxes, and such other information deemed necessary by the Tax Commission.

(b) Sales approach.

   (1) The market or sales comparison approach to finding value relies on recent sales of properties of similar size, age, and location.

   (2) The Tax Commission will rely on comparable sales as the primary valuation method for properties in tax class one.

   (3) The Tax Commission may rely on comparable sales as the primary valuation method for properties in tax class two with four to ten residential units.

   (4) Sales offered as evidence shall be identified by date, address and block and lot, and exterior description of the property.

   (5) Sales are recent if they have occurred within two years before or within two years after the tax status date, January 5.

   (6) Sales shall be offered as evidence only upon personal knowledge or belief in good faith that the properties are comparable. If no recent comparable sales exist, other recent sales may be offered with reasonable adjustments for differences that are identified.

(c) Income approach.

   (1) The income approach to finding value relies on the income that the property generates or can generate. A year's net operating income, based on reported figures or estimates, may be divided by a capitalization rate to find value. Alternatively, value may be derived by multiplying one year's gross rental income by a factor derived from analysis of open market transfers of comparable properties.

   (2) The Tax Commission will rely on the income approach as the primary valuation method for properties in tax class two with more than ten units and tax class four. The Tax Commission may rely on the income approach for properties in tax class two with ten or fewer units.

   (3) The Tax Commission may require, in addition to completion of the prescribed forms, submission of copies of rent rolls prepared in the normal course of business and other documents as may be deemed relevant by the Tax Commission to the determination of value.

   (4) To establish the value of properties that do not currently generate rental income, such as owner-occupied properties, properties held in the cooperative or condominium form of ownership, and owner-occupied condominium units, evidence of rental income and operating expenses from comparable rental buildings shall be provided. Such rental buildings shall be similar in age, number, size and type of apartments, number of floors, and location.

   (5) Comparable rental buildings shall be offered as evidence only upon personal knowledge or belief in good faith that the properties are comparable. If there are no comparable properties, other rental buildings may be offered with adjustments for differences that are identified.

   (6) Representatives and self-represented applicants relying on rental income and operating expenses from comparable buildings in their argument at the hearing shall submit a written summary of the information relied upon at the hearing.

   (7) For residential condominium units, documentary evidence of rental income, if any, such as signed leases and copies of rent checks, shall be provided.

   (8) The Tax Commission may rely on the income approach for properties used as hotels, motels, retail department stores, parking sites, and theaters.

(d) Cost approach.

   (1) The cost approach to value relies on the cost of reproducing the existing structure, less depreciation.

   (2) The Tax Commission will rely on the cost approach as the primary valuation method for specialty properties, including utility structures and equipment.

   (3) The Tax Commission will rely on the cost approach as the primary valuation method for newly constructed properties and for valuation of alterations to existing properties.

(e) The hearing officer may consider any reasonable valuation approach or a combination of approaches in determining value.

(f) The hearing officer may:

   (1) cause the person verifying the application or another person with personal knowledge to appear;

   (2) take testimony under oath;

   (3) require the applicant to produce for examination such books, records and documents upon which the application is based; and

   (4) visit and inspect the property.

(g) The hearing officer may upon notice to the reresentative or self-represented applicant require submission at or after a hearing additional information, including without limitation statements, documents, records, or photographs, that the hearing officer considers material to determine the application.

(h) All testimony at a hearing shall be given under oath. All written information and documents offered by representatives and self-represented applicants for consideration at a hearing, or on review without a hearing, shall be authenticated upon personal knowledge.

(i) Written statements submitted after the filing of an application to cure factual omissions or errors in the application shall be verified upon personal knowledge.

(j) If the property is occupied, in whole or part, by the applicant or a related entity, the applicant shall so state.

(k) If the applicant is a lessee, the applicant shall upon request of the hearing officer provide a copy of the lease or memorandum of lease and shall certify the nature of the relation, if any, between the parties to the lease.

(l) If the applicant's claim concerns valuation of a new building or an alteration of an existing improvement, the applicant shall provide copies of contracts, cancelled checks or other documentary evidence of all costs of construction or alteration. The applicant shall state if any exemption application is pending or contemplated.

(m) If the applicant's claim rests on a judgment of foreclosure, the applicant shall present evidence of the foreclosure, unpaid balance of mortgage, if any, and all other pertinent information.

(n) If the applicant's claim rests on an adjudication of bankruptcy, the applicant shall present evidence of such adjudication and all other pertinent information.

(o) If the applicant's claim rests on a change of law, the applicant shall provide a statement of the law and authorities substantiating the claim.

(p) If the applicant's claim rests on demolition of or physical damage to the property, the applicant shall upon request of the hearing officer present evidence of the type and extent of damage, the type and extent of insurance coverage, governmental assistance for which the applicant has applied or will apply, litigation to recover for such damage that the applicant has commenced or will commence, existing tenancies, if any, and plans to repair, renovate or reconstruct the property.

(i) An acceptance is filed when it is received in the Tax Commission's Office. A Tax Commission receipt form is the only proof of timely filing recognized by the Tax Commission.

(j) If, after an offer and before acceptance, there has been a transfer of the property or the applicant's interest in the property, execution of a contract to sell, or a new net lease negotiated or executed, these facts shall be disclosed in the form prescribed for that purpose with a request for re-offer within the time allowed for acceptance, unless the applicant chooses not to accept the offer.

(k) Offers are subject to review and approval and revocation by the Tax Commission.
