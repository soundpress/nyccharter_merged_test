Title 63: Landmarks Preservation Commission
===================================================

Chapter 1: Practice and Procedure--Public Hearings and Meetings of the Commission
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 1-01 Quorum.* ::


A quorum of the Landmarks Preservation Commission shall consist of six Commissioners. Public hearings and public meetings may be conducted without a quorum.






*§ 1-02 Calendaring.* ::


The Landmarks Preservation Commission may, upon the adoption of a motion, calendar an item to be considered for landmark designation. A motion to calendar must be approved by the majority of the Commissioners present in order to be adopted. The date of the public hearing on the proposed designation may be set by the motion to calendar or it may be set at some later time by the Chairman, acting at his or her discretion.






*§ 1-03 Withdrawing and Laying Over Certificate of Appropriateness Items.* ::


Once an application has been included on a Certificate of Appropriateness public hearing calendar, it may be withdrawn or laid-over as follows:

(a) Lay-Overs (requests prior to being heard). If an application has been included on a Certificate of Appropriateness calendar and the hearing has not yet occurred, the applicant may request that the application be laid-over to a subsequent public hearing. The applicant must send the Landmarks Preservation Commission a letter indicating that he or she would prefer to be heard on a subsequent hearing and stating that the Commission's time to act on the matter is being extended for an equivalent length of time. Upon receipt of this request staff will withdraw the item and hold it for the following month's hearing. Where the application concerns, in whole or in part, the legalization or curing of a violation, the applicant shall be allowed to lay over the item only once as of right. If the applicant requests a subsequent lay-over, the Chair may at his or her own discretion consider the request a request for withdrawal and may withdraw the item pursuant to the procedure set forth in subsection (b)(1) of this section, or, if the application seeks to legalize a violation, the Chair may keep the item on the calendar and the Commission may act on it at the public hearing. Withdrawal of an application to legalize or cure a violation, in whole or in part, shall be deemed a dissapproval for purposes of service of a second or subsequent notice of violation pursuant to Administrative Code § 25-317.1b(4)(a)(ii).

(b) Withdrawals (requests prior to being heard). If an application has been included on a Certificate of Appropriateness public hearing calendar and the hearing has not yet occurred, the application may be withdrawn from the calendar as follows:

   (1) by the applicant if the applicant sends a letter to the Landmarks Preservation Commission indicating that he or she wishes to abandon the application as proposed. Staff withdraws the item and generates the "Withdrawn at Staff Level" number from "Permit Application Tracking System", a withdrawal letter is sent to the applicant and the application is closed.

   (2) by the staff if new information or design modifications are provided that enable the staff to issue a staff-level permit. Staff withdraws the item from the calendar and issues a staff permit to close the application.

   (3) by the staff at the direction of the Director of Preservation if the status of the application changes with respect to scope and completeness.

(c) Withdrawals from calendar (after having been heard). If an application has been included on a Certificate of Appropriateness public hearing calendar and the hearing has taken place, the application can only be withdrawn by the applicant if he or she sends a letter to the Landmarks Preservation Commission indicating that the application is being abandoned as proposed. Upon receipt of this request staff will withdraw the item from the calendar, generate a "Withdrawn at Staff Level" number from "Permit Application Tracing System" and send the applicant a withdrawal letter to close the application. Where the application concerns, in whole or in part, the legalization of a violation, the Chair may, at his or her own discretion, reject the applicant's request to withdraw and the Commission may continue to consider and act on the application as submitted. Withdrawal of an application to legalize or cure a violation, in whole or in part, shall be deemed a dissapproval for purposes of service of a second or subsequent notice of violation pursuant to Administrative Code § 25-317.1b(4)(a)(ii).






*§ 1-04 Final Actions.* ::


No final determination or action will be made or taken except by concurring vote of at least six Commissioners.






*§ 1-05 Submissions to the Record.* ::


The Commission may, upon the adoption of a motion, close the hearing and leave the Record open on a particular item until a stated date to allow for the submission of additional written information. Submissions received after the stated date will be included in the Record provided they are received prior to the Commission's determination or action on the item. The Commission will neither make a final determination nor take any final action on an item while the Record is open on that item.




Chapter 2: Approval of Proposed Work on Designated Buildings and Structures
--------------------------------------------------




**Subchapter A: Application Procedure**



*§ 2-01 Application Signatures Necessary for Work Permits.* ::


All application forms to perform any work on a designated landmark or on a property in a designated historic district must be signed by the owner of the property. An application for work on or in a cooperative building must be signed by the President or other appropriate officer of the Co-op Board. The signature of the managing agent of the cooperative building is not sufficient. An application for work on or in the areas and portions of a condominium building in common ownership must be signed by the President or other appropriate officer of the Condominium Association. An application for work on or in an individual condominium unit must be signed by the owner of that unit.






*§ 2-02 Master Plans and Authorizations to Proceed.* ::


An owner of a designated property may apply for approval of a master plan when the proposal involves repetitive alteration of architectural features (such as windows, through-wall air conditioning installations, storefronts, etc.) and when those alterations are not planned to occur all at once, but rather in increments through time. A master plan can be approved by a Certificate of Appropriateness or by a Permit for Minor Work depending on the work which it covers. In both cases the master plan sets a standard for future changes involving the architectural features in question and specifically identifies drawings and other documents which contain the approved design in detail. Once a master plan is approved and the owner wishes to move forward with a portion of the work covered by the master plan, a completed application form is filed with the Commission describing the scope of work (for example: 8 front windows on the 12th floor) and stating that the work will conform to the approved master plan drawings and other documents on file with the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The staff of the Preservation Department will review the application to ascertain that all proposed work is covered by a master plan, and will send the owner an "Authorization to Proceed" letter allowing the work to proceed. The Authorization to Proceed is sent prior to the commencement of the work and is contingent on adherence to the approved master plan drawings.






*§ 2-03 Process for Completing Application: Staff Withdrawal of the Application.* ::


(a)  All applications for work on designated properties received by the Landmarks Preservation Commission are assigned to a professional staff member in the Preservation Department who will handle the project. The staff person will review the proposal to ascertain whether the materials submitted are sufficient for a determination to be made. If the materials are sufficient, staff will certify the application as complete and issue the appropriate permit or take other action. If the completed application requires a Certificate of Appropriateness, staff will arrange for the item to be included in the next scheduled Certificate of Appropriateness public hearing calendar. If the application requires further clarification and/or additional documentary materials, staff will contact the owner and/or applicant by telephone to discuss the proposal and, if necessary, arrange a meeting or site visit. Staff will follow the conversation up by providing a materials checklist calling out those supplementary materials required to certify the application as complete. If contact has been limited to a telephone conversation, the checklist will be mailed to the applicant. If a meeting is set up, the checklist may be supplied during the course of the meeting. As soon as all the materials requested have been received, staff will certify the application as complete and process the application. However, if the required materials have not been received 60 working days from the date on the materials checklist, staff will send a follow-up letter to the applicant reminding him/her that the application is still incomplete and informing him/her that unless the materials required are received within the next 30 working days the application will be deemed withdrawn. A copy of the most recent materials checklist will be included with the letter. If the applicant does not submit sufficient material within 90 days of the date on the materials checklist, staff should withdraw the application by sending a staff withdrawal letter including the docket number of the application and a "Withdrawn at Staff Level" number generated by "Permit Application Training System". The application will then be closed. The staff withdrawal letter will be sent to the owner and applicant with copies forwarded to the file, supervisor, and the Director of Preservation. Along with the withdrawal letter a blank "Application for Work on Designated Properties" will be included for the use of the applicant should he or she wish to re-apply.

(b) Notwithstanding the time periods set forth in subdivision (a), where an application seeks to legalize or cure a violation, an applicant must submit all materials required by the materials checklist within 20 working days of the date of the materials checklist. If the materials are not submitted, the staff shall send a follow-up letter that shall inform the applicant that the application may be withdrawn by the staff unless all required materials are submitted within 15 working days of the date of the follow-up letter. If the applicant fails to submit all required materials within 55 working days of the date of the first materials checklist, the staff may withdraw the application as set forth in subdivision (a). Withdrawal of an application to legalize or cure a violation, in whole or in part, shall be deemed a disapproval for purposes of service of a second or subsequent notice of violation pursuant to Administrative Code § 25-317.1b(4)(a)(ii).






*§ 2-04 Summonses – New Applications.* ::


The Landmarks Preservation Commission will not process an application for work on a designated property when a Landmarks Preservation Commission Summons is in effect against that property. A Summons in effect against that property indicates non-compliance with the Landmarks Law. With respect to Chapter 63* of the Rules of the City of New York and §§ 25-301 through 25-322 of the Administrative Code, the term "Summons" will be construed to include and apply to any previously issued "Notice of Violation."

*Editor's note: So in original; should likely be "Title 63".

(a) Effect of a Summons on Processing of a New Application. Upon receipt of an application, LPC Staff must verify that no Summons is in effect against the property. If a Summons is in effect, LPC Staff will:

   (1) Obtain copies of all Summonses, previously issued Notices of Violation and Notices to Stop Work for the file.

   (2) Contact the owner/applicant to inform them that because a Summons is in effect LPC Staff cannot process an application for new work until the Summons has been rescinded.

   (3) Send a letter to the applicant explaining that LPC Staff cannot process the new application because a Summons is in effect against the property, that processing can only commence upon rescission of the Summons or when the applicant begins to address the conditions described in the Summons. Along with the letter send copies of the Summons, an application form, and instructions for filing. Send copies of the letter to the Supervisor, and the Director of Enforcement.

(b) Exceptions to this Procedure. LPC Staff may issue permits for new work when a Summons is in effect in the following instances:

   (1) The proposed work will correct a hazardous condition.

   (2) The proposed work will address deterioration affecting the building, and the work will clearly further the continuing preservation of the building.

   (3) A permit has been issued to correct work cited in a Summons, and an escrow agreement or other acceptable form of assurance has been established to provide a mechanism, acceptable to the Landmarks Preservation Commission, that ensures that the corrective work approved under the permit to address the Summons will be completed within a specified time period.








*§ 2-05 Temporary Installations.* ::


LPC Staff is authorized to approve and issue a Certificate of No Effect (CNE) or Permit for Minor Work (PMW) for proposals calling for the temporary installation of signs, banners or other temporary installations such as various forms of artwork or kiosks, if the following criteria are met:

(a) "Temporary Installation" is defined as an installation for one hundred eighty (180) days or less for signs and banners or one (1) calendar year or less for other temporary installations. The duration of any temporary installation authorized under this rule will be specified in the CNE or PMW. Any temporary installation must be for a single period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days for signs and banners or one (1) calendar year for other temporary installations. An approval for a temporary installation cannot be renewed pursuant to 63 RCNY Chapter 7, nor shall such installation be the subject of a subsequent application for a temporary approval. However, approvals of temporary installations related to approved construction on the property and temporary installations on publicly owned properties may be renewed for up to two additional installation periods. With respect to temporary installations related to approved construction on the property, LPC Staff will make a determination, prior to renewing the approval, that the project is proceeding with reasonable promptness; and

(b) The installation will cause no damage to protected architectural features of the property; and

(c) An acceptable plan and time schedule for the dismantling of the installation has been submitted to the Commission as a component of the application, along with specifications for any repair work that might be required after dismantling of the installation. In the case of artwork, the applicant is also required to submit a written instrument signed by the artist and the building owner that evidences the owner's authority to remove the artwork when the temporary installation permit expires and that waives any protection under applicable federal or state law afforded to the artist or artwork that would prevent such removal at the expiration of the temporary permit, including but not limited to, the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, 17 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq. and Article 14 of the New York State Law on Arts and Cultural Affairs; and

(d) With respect to temporary installations related to approved construction work, an acceptable plan for dismantling, storing and reinstalling any significant features that had to be removed to perform such work has been submitted to the Commission; and

(e) If the applicant is not a public or quasi-public agency, an escrow agreement or other adequate assurance acceptable to the Commission is provided to establish that a mechanism is available for the removal of the installation upon expiration of the permit should the applicant fail to remove the installation.

(f) The time period for an approval of a temporary installation will commence upon issuance of the temporary permit, unless the approval explicitly provides for a different commencement date.









**Subchapter B: Specific Alterations**



*§ 2-11 Repair, Restoration, Replacement and Re-creation of Building Facades and Related Exterior Elements.* ::


(a) Introduction. This section authorizes LPC Staff to approve applications for work to repair, restore and re-create building facades and related exterior elements in order to maintain, restore, replace, re-create and, in certain instances, recall original or historic exterior architectural elements. LPC Staff reviews these applications with the presumption that historic materials should be maintained, repaired and replaced in-kind whenever possible. This approach results in the most authentic and sympathetic interventions and preserves the design, materiality and engineering of the historic building or improvement and its features. Furthermore, the use of historic materials and methods typically ensures compatibility with surrounding materials in terms of expansion and contraction, permeability and absorption, and structural capacity, among other things. Most historic material are proven to be long-lasting and durable when properly maintained, and will age and perform in a predicable way in support of the long-term economic viability of their continued use. Notwithstanding the preference for original and historic materials, LPC Staff may consider alternative repair methods and substitute materials in certain situations as set forth in this subdivision, while in other situations use of substitute materials is prohibited.

For purposes of this section, the term "primary facade" means: (1) a facade fronting a street or public thoroughfare that is not a street, such as a mews or court; (2) A visible facade that possesses a level of design or significant architectural features that are commensurate with the building's street-fronting facade(s), and where such facade (i) faces but does not front a street, such as a setback facade, or (ii) is part of a dominant massing element where at least one facade is street-fronting or street-facing, such as a tower element; or (3) A facade with a primary entrance to the building.

(b) General Conditions and Requirements.

   (1) Probes and other investigative work. No permit is required for non-intrusive investigative work or probes, provided the work is fully reversible and does not damage any historic fabric, and further provided that the existing condition is reinstated upon completion. LPC Staff may approve and issue an approval for selective intrusive investigative work or probes in order to assess the current condition of building materials and systems, or for the temporary removal of a feature or portion of a feature in order to make a mold for replication, if the proposed work meets all of the following applicable criteria:

      (i) The probes or removal(s) are requested in connection with an anticipated or open application for work, or for an approval that has been granted;

      (ii) No more material will be removed than is necessary to discover the underlying condition or make the mold for replication and, where possible, removal will be limited to non-character defining features and materials;

      (iii) The probe(s) or removal(s) will be performed in an unobtrusive location;

      (iv) Temporary protection of the area being probed will be provided; and

      (v) Where original fabric is removed in connection with the probe, it will be re-installed to match the original condition, or if necessary the material will be replaced in-kind. For removals in connection with making a mold for replication, the original fabric will be re-installed or adequate protective measures will be taken to ensure that the facade is kept watertight until such time as the reinstallation or replacement of the feature is complete.

   (2) Documentation and assessment of deteriorated conditions. The applicant must provide current photographs of the building as documentation of deteriorated conditions, along with a written scope of work summary. Where replacement of large quantities of materials and/or significant architectural features is proposed, the applicant must provide an assessment of the deteriorated conditions warranting such replacement(s). Repair will be given priority over replacement if feasible.

   (3) Physical and aesthetic characteristics of materials and features. In all cases, except where noted, the repair, restoration, replacement or re-creation must match the original or historic materials and features in terms of its physical and aesthetic characteristics, including design, detail, profile, dimension, material, texture, tooling, dressing, color and finish, as applicable.

   (4) Specifications. The specifications, methods and materials for the repair, restoration, replacement or re-creation must be identified and described by the architect, engineer or contractor as part of a written scope of work or specifications manual or on the filing drawings.

   (5) Samples. LPC Staff may, prior to commencement of the work and as a condition of approval or as a stipulation for continuing work, require that samples of work, including samples of materials, methods and finishes, be prepared for review and approval. The applicant may notify the LPC Staff by letter or email that the samples are ready for review. LPC Staff may request photographs of the samples or delivery of the samples to the LPC Staff member prior to the site visit. Work may not commence or proceed until LPC Staff has approved the sample(s). With respect to a request for samples:

      (i) Samples of joint preparation for repointing work at primary facades of a small size and at locations requiring repointing will be provided prior to raking or cutting the entire facade(s);

      (ii) The applicant must provide at least two (2) samples of pointing, masonry repairs, and/or replacement unit masonry, of a size to be determined by LPC Staff, and the samples must be located at areas requiring the repairs where reasonable and feasible;

      (iii) Samples must be adequately set or dried prior to photographing or contacting LPC Staff to arrange for a site inspection;

      (iv) Samples approved by LPC Staff will serve as the standard for the entire job; and

      (v) For certain scopes of work, such as large amounts of masonry replacement or facade reconstruction, LPC Staff may require a separate sign-off of the samples, including stopping work and submission of photographs or a site visit, once a portion of the work, as stipulated by LPC Staff, has been completed.

   (6) Shop drawings. LPC Staff may, prior to issuance of a permit, or prior to commencement of the work and as a condition of approval or as a stipulation for continuing work, require the submission and approval of shop drawings for the in-kind replacement of significant architectural features.

   (7) Environmental conditions. The repair, restoration, replacement, or reconstruction of mortar joints and unit masonry will be performed only when the temperature remains at a constant 45 degrees Fahrenheit or above for a 72-hour period from the commencement of the work. Other means and methods for providing a comparable controlled environment, such as providing heated enclosures or heating the material itself, may be considered on a case-by-case basis subject to review and approval by LPC staff.

(c) Repair or Restoration of Facade Materials and Features. Where the applicant has provided documentation, assessment, and specifications, as applicable, LPC Staff will approve repair or restoration of deteriorated facade materials and features as provided below.

   (1) Cleaning and removal of paint and coatings. LPC Staff will approve cleaning and removing paint and coatings from exterior masonry and cast iron facades if the proposed work meets all of the following applicable criteria:

      (i) Cleaning and paint removal products and methodologies will provide for the gentlest effective method to avoid causing damage to the masonry; and

      (ii) Water pressure will be the lowest necessary to clean and remove paint or coatings and will not exceed 300 psi for cast iron or 500 psi for masonry.

   (2) Painting and coating of facades.

      (i) Painting facades and features that were originally or historically painted and are currently unpainted. LPC Staff will approve painting facades and building features that historically were painted in order to protect them from damage or return them more closely to their historic appearance if the proposed work meets all of the following applicable criteria:

         (A) The paint will match original or historic paint in terms of physical and aesthetic characteristics, and the color will be in keeping with the historic color palette of the building's type, style, and age, except that in the case of historic masonry the proposed color will match the color of the underlying masonry, unless the color is part of a significant later alteration. For Individual Landmarks, if a substantial portion of the paint on a primary facade is being removed, the applicant must perform a paint analysis unless one already exists;

         (B) A particular finish that is already required pursuant to an LPC Modification of Use or Bulk, or was an important criterion for an approval of a Certificate of Appropriateness application, will be maintained.

      (ii) Painting non-original or altered features or facades. LPC Staff will approve the painting of facades or features that are not original, or were altered or damaged prior to designation, in order to improve their appearance or conceal non-original materials, if the proposed work meets all of the following applicable criteria:

         (A) The paint will blend with the surrounding materials, helping the feature recede from view; or

         (B) The paint will be harmonious with other elements on the building or adjacent buildings, thereby helping unify the appearance and relationship of the elements.

         (C) Repainting a facade or feature to match the existing condition does not require a permit, provided the existing condition is grandfathered or approved by the Commission. Any perceptible change in color will require a permit, subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (2)(A) and (B) of this subdivision. See subparagraph (iii) below for use of non-paint coatings, as applicable.

      (iii) Coating masonry facades and features. LPC Staff will approve coating masonry facades and building features with non-paint material, such as a mineral coating or stain that is absorbed into the substrate and/or bonds with it, in order to protect them from damage, if the proposed work meets all of the following applicable criteria:

         (A) Water infiltration has occurred or is occurring through the facade or feature due to its deteriorated surface condition; or

         (B) The base of the facade has been subjected to graffiti on a recurring basis; and

         (C) The coating will be highly breathable, and in most cases will be clear with a dull finish to maintain the appearance of the underlying masonry unless some coloration is desirable to conceal prior non-matching repairs or surface damage; and

         (D) The coating will not be a waterproofing product, unless such product already exists on the building facade or feature and cannot be removed without damaging the underlying material, and the scope of recoating is limited to touching up small areas. A larger scope of recoating, or complete recoating, may not be approved if there is potential for diminishing breathability and damaging the facade or feature due to build-up of multiple layers of the coating.

   (3) Pointing of mortar joints. LPC Staff will approve raking, cutting and pointing mortar joints with a cementitious mortar mix, if the proposed work meets all of the following applicable criteria:

      (i) The mortar will match original or historic mortar in terms of physical and aesthetic characteristics. For Individual Landmarks a mortar analysis must be performed if a substantial amount of the primary facade is being repointed;

      (ii) The mortar type will be of a strength less than, and permeability greater than, that of the masonry unit, and the mortar mix will typically consist of lime, white or gray Portland cement, and sand, plus pigments as required;

      (iii) If the facade has been previously pointed in a color, texture or tooling not matching the original or historic mortar, and only limited areas of the facade require repointing, the mortar may match the existing mortar;

      (iv) If the majority of mortar joints have been previously widened by improper cutting to the extent that it changes the character of the brickwork, the mortar may be an alternative color, texture or tooling that helps to unify the appearance of the facade; and

      (v) The joints will be raked by hand without power tools, except that wide joints may be mechanically cut with power tools if specifications for execution are provided to ensure there will be no over-cutting into masonry or widening of mortar joints which would cause irreversible damage to the brick.

   (4) Repair of natural and cast stone. LPC Staff will approve the repair of natural and cast stone (concrete mixtures that employ molded shapes, decorative aggregates, and masonry pigments to simulate natural stone) elements if the proposed work meets all of the following applicable criteria:

      (i) For rusticated stone, special decorative elements, and types of stone which are difficult to recreate with a cementitious patch, LPC Staff will approve an application to reset, re-tool or consolidate the significant fabric, or install Dutchmen. As used in this subparagraph, the term "Dutchman" refers to any new or matching salvaged stone fitted into the existing facade stone as follows:

         (A) The Dutchman repair will match original or historic stone in terms of its physical and aesthetic characteristics; and

         (B) Materials and methods for adhesives and/or anchoring will be compatible with the stone, and will be discreet or concealed from view.

      (ii) For other types of stone, LPC Staff will approve an application to remove the original stone surface and patch or resurface it with a cementitious mix, if the proposed work meets all of the following applicable criteria:

         (A) The deteriorated portions of the stone will be cut back to sound stone and the new surface keyed into the sound stone with a tinted cementitious patching compound or built up in successive layers using a cementitious mix with the top layer tinted, and will match original or historic stone in terms of its physical and aesthetic characteristics;

         (B) Materials and methods for anchoring will be compatible with the stone and the cementitious patching compound or mix, and will be discreet or concealed from view.

   (5) Repair of fired clay and ceramic unit masonry (including brick and terra cotta). LPC Staff will approve an application to repair brick, glazed terra cotta or other fired unit masonry surfaces if the proposed work meets all of the following applicable criteria:

      (i) Repairs will match the original or historic brick or terra cotta in terms of physical and aesthetic characteristics;

      (ii) Repairs are limited to minor spalling or chipping of the brick or terra cotta glazing;

      (iii) Deteriorated areas of glazing are painted with a compatible coating to match the original glaze finish.

   (6) Repair of stucco. LPC Staff will approve an application to repair stucco elements and surfaces, including any underlying wood or metal lathe, if the proposed work meets all of the following applicable criteria:

      (i) The stucco or cementitious patching compound will match original or historic stucco in terms of physical and aesthetic characteristics;

      (ii) Materials and methods for anchoring, fasteners, control or expansion joints, and/or sealants will be compatible with the stucco and the underlying material, and will be discreet or concealed from view.

   (7) Repair of ornamental sheet metal. LPC Staff will approve an application to repair sheet metal elements by removing, repairing and reinstalling existing elements, if the proposed work meets all of the following applicable criteria:

      (i) The sheet metal repair will match original or historic ornamental sheet metal in terms of physical and aesthetic characteristics; and

      (ii) Materials and methods for anchoring, fasteners, soldering, patching, filling and/or sealants will be compatible with the ornamental sheet metal, and will be discreet or concealed from view.

   (8) Repair of cast and wrought iron and other cast or extruded ornamental metals. LPC Staff will approve an application to repair cast, wrought or extruded metal elements by removing, repairing and reinstalling existing elements, if the proposed work meets all of the following applicable criteria:

      (i) The cast, wrought or extruded metal repair will match original or historic cast and wrought iron and other cast or extruded ornamental metals in terms of physical and aesthetic characteristics;

      (ii) Materials and methods for anchoring, fasteners, welding, patching, filling and/or sealants will be compatible with the cast and wrought iron and other cast or extruded ornamental metals, and will be discreet or concealed from view.

   (9) Repair of wood features. LPC Staff will approve an application to repair wood elements by removing, repairing and reinstalling existing elements, if the proposed work meets all of the following applicable criteria:

      (i) The wood repair will match original or historic wood in terms of physical and aesthetic characteristics; and

      (ii) Materials and methods for anchoring, fasteners, patching, filling, piecing-in ("Dutchmen" repairs), consolidating, or other reinforcement will be compatible with the wood, and will be discreet or concealed from view.

   (10) Repair of other materials. LPC Staff will approve the repair of other materials or building facades that do not fall into any of the previously described categories, including but not limited to laminates, plastic and synthetic rubbers, curtain walls, and poured concrete, if the repair will match original or historic material in terms of physical and aesthetic characteristics. In connection with such repairs, LPC Staff may approve the repair of minor portions of these other materials with substitute materials that otherwise match the physical and aesthetic characteristics, provided the use of substitute materials will not detract from the original materials.

(d) Replacement of Deteriorated Architectural Features. Where the applicant has provided adequate documentation and assessment that an architectural feature cannot be repaired and retained, typically in the form of a descriptive analysis and photographic and/or other evidence, LPC staff will approve replacement of such a feature as provided below. For purposes of this subdivision, "architectural feature" means both the individual components (e.g., cornice, lintel, band course or column) and the material (e.g., brick, stone, wood or terra cotta) that comprise the basic facade material.

   (1) Criteria.

      (i) Replacement materials and features should match the original or historic material or feature in terms of physical and aesthetic characteristics. For purposes of this subdivision, this means that replacement material should be "in-kind" in terms of using the actual original or historic material and installation techniques. In-kind replacement should be prioritized and fully considered prior to proposing substitute materials.

      (ii) Materials other than the original or historic material (hereinafter "substitute materials") may be approved in some cases where the substitute material matches or recalls the appearance of the original or historic material in terms of texture, finish, color and details, with the expectation that it will be long-lasting and maintained, provided the substitute material and installation methods do not directly or indirectly damage the surrounding original or historic material, the substitute material and/or its installation methods are not discernible or otherwise call attention to the work, and as provided for, and limited by, this subdivision and subdivisions (e) and (f). Unless otherwise authorized, a substitute material may not be used to replace all or a substantial portion of an entire facade. LPC Staff may request a written explanation describing the reason(s) for proposing to use a substitute material in lieu of an in-kind replacement.

      (iii) Substitute materials may not be used at buildings seeking or subject to a special permit ("Modification of Use and Bulk" or "MOU"), except where the approval requires or anticipates the use of substitute materials, and except if the original or historic material is no longer commercially available and replacement in-kind is infeasible. In addition, substitute materials may not be used on a building or portions of a building where in-kind replacement was an important aspect of an approval of a Certificate of Appropriateness application.

      (iv) Requirements for the replacement of historic materials in-kind and the use of substitute materials are as follows:

         (A) Cast iron. Replacement of cast iron with a painted finish must be in-kind at or below the sixth story at the primary facade(s), except that cast aluminum or another cast metal with a painted finish may be used. In addition to these provisions, above the sixth story at primary facade(s) and at secondary facades, substitute materials may also be used for limited quantities of discrete elements. At Individual Landmarks, substitute materials may not be used.

         (B) Cast metals and sheet metals. Replacement of cast metals and sheet metals with a natural finish, and wrought metals, must be in-kind at or below the sixth story at the primary facade(s). Above the sixth story at primary facade(s), substitute materials may be used. At Individual Landmarks, substitute materials may not be used.

         (C) Brick and stucco. Replacement of brick and stucco must be in-kind at any location on the building. At Individual Landmarks, substitute materials may not be used.

         (D) Cast and natural stone. Replacement of (historic) cast stone and natural stone (other than brownstone) must be in-kind at or below the sixth story at the primary facade(s), except substitute materials may be used for coping elements. In addition to these provisions, above the sixth story at primary facade(s), substitute materials may also be used at projecting cornices and balconies with weight and/or attachment issues when in-kind replacement has the potential to cause additional loss of surrounding materials, as determined by a licensed engineer; and for limited quantities of other discrete elements that are not part of a cladding field of similar units where physical and visual compatibility is critical. At Individual Landmarks, substitute materials may not be used, except for coping elements.

         (E) Brownstone. Replacement of brownstone may be in-kind at the primary facade(s), or cast stone may be used for facade elements and features, and cast stone or stucco over backup masonry may be used at stoops and areaway walls. At Individual Landmarks, stucco over backup masonry may not be used.

         (F) Terra cotta. Replacement of terra cotta must be in-kind at or below the sixth story at the primary facade(s), except substitute materials may be used for coping elements, as well as for limited quantities of other discrete elements that are not part of a cladding field of similar units where physical and visual compatibility is critical. In addition to these provisions, above the sixth story at primary facade(s), substitute materials may also be used at projecting cornices and balconies with weight and/or attachment issues when in-kind replacement has the potential to cause additional loss of surrounding materials, as determined by a licensed engineer. At Individual Landmarks, substitute material may not be used, except for coping elements, as well as for limited quantities of other discrete elements that are not part of a cladding field of similar units where physical and visual compatibility is critical.

         (G) Wood siding. Replacement of wood siding must be in-kind at the primary facade(s) and at Individual Landmarks, except that fiber-cement board may be used only if applicable building, fire or other code(s) prohibit the use of wood siding, provided the use of the substitute material is the minimum required by such code(s).

         (H) Painted wood and sheet metal. Replacement of painted wood and sheet metal elements must be in-kind at the primary facade(s), except that painted wood and sheet metal elements may be used interchangeably at facade elements that were historically used in a similar manner, such as cornices and bay windows; and other substitute materials may be used at elaborate top floor cornices less than 25 feet in length where any joints in the material would be hidden or obscured by the design elements. Above the sixth story at primary facade(s), substitute materials may be used. At Individual Landmarks, substitute materials may not be used.

         (I) Roofing material. Replacement of original or historic roofing, flashing, gutters, leaders, and/or decorative elements, or replace roofing where the original or historic roofing material has been removed, must meet all of the following applicable criteria:

            (a) The new roofing components will match the original or historic roofing components in terms of their physical and aesthetic characteristics; or

            (b) If the original or historic roofing is existing, LPC Staff may approve a substitute material at roofs of buildings six stories tall or less at the primary facade if the material is not visible from a public thoroughfare. For buildings seven stories tall or greater, substitute materials may be used at the primary and secondary facades if the material is not visible or minimally visible from a public thoroughfare, where because of the height or discreet presence the substitute material will not be discernible or will not call attention to itself or detract from the significant historic features of the building, or district if the building is in a historic district. In all cases, new visible flashing, gutters, leaders and/or decorative elements will match the original or historic materials. All substitute materials must satisfy the criteria of clause (c) below. This clause (b) does not apply to Individual Landmarks or buildings seeking or subject to a special permit ("Modification of Use or Bulk" or "MOU").

            (c) If the original or historic roofing is missing, LPC Staff may approve a substitute material that recalls, but does not necessarily match, the original or historic roofing in terms of its visual characteristics (including artificial slate or clay shingles, architectural asphalt shingles, and "solar shingles", which are designed to look like and function as conventional roofing material while also producing electricity), if the substitute material will not call attention to itself or detract from the significant historic features of the building, or district if the building is in a historic district, provided that any new visible flashing, gutters, leaders and/or decorative elements will match the original or historic materials. This clause (c) does not apply to buildings seeking or subject to a special permit ("Modification of Use or Bulk" or "MOU"). For purposes of this clause (c):

               (1) If the existing roofing material is asphalt shingles, the new roofing material can be asphalt shingles provided it is an architectural shingle that better recalls the historic roofing material; and

               (2) Standing seam metal roofing may be replaced in kind.

            (d) If the roof is a flat roof, no LPC permit is required to replace the flat roof, including proposals to install or increase insulation as part of the replacement. However, any alterations or replacement of visible flashing, gutter, leaders and/or decorative elements, or raising or installing of visible railings, associated with the flat roof replacement will be subject to LPC Staff and Commissioners' review and must meet applicable criteria as identified in this section.

         (J) Where a substitute material has previously been approved as an aspect of a Certificate of Appropriateness application, LPC Staff may continue the use of the same or other comparable substitute material in new applications for the same building or structure consistent with that approval, provided the substitute material has proven to be an acceptable match in terms of appearance and compatibility over time with the surrounding original or historic material.

      (v) Except as otherwise prohibited by the criteria of this subdivision, substitute materials may be approved at any location on a secondary facade not fronting on a publicly accessible thoroughfare if the substitute material will not be discernible or will not call attention to itself or detract from the significant historic features of the building, or district, if the building is in a historic district.

(e) Reconstruction of Facades. For buildings in historic districts, if the entire facade cannot be stabilized and repaired in-place, the applicant must provide a structural conditions report from a licensed professional engineer, an assessment of the existing materials and potential for unit masonry and other features to be salvaged and re-used, and fully-dimensioned survey drawings of the facade. The recommendation for reconstruction of a primary facade made by the engineer will be subject to peer review by an structural engineer contracted with by the Commission, who must concur with the recommendation in order for LPC staff to approve the application. Historic facade material must be salvaged and reused to the greatest extent feasible at primary facades. This subdivision (e) does not apply to Individual Landmarks or buildings seeking or subject to a special permit ("Modification of Use and Bulk" or "MOU").

   (1) The facade must be reconstructed in kind in terms of wall construction, including full-width brick and stone at the outer wythe, except that back-up masonry can be either brick or concrete masonry units. Existing modified architectural features that are not significant later alterations must be recreated to match their original or historic appearance at primary facades and visible secondary facades. For example, if the lintels or sills have been stripped, and the modification is not a significant later alteration, the proposal must include recreating the original or historic sills or lintels. Substitute materials may be employed in recreating these historic details, as provided for by subdivision (d).

(f) Re-Creation and Restoration of Missing Facade Features. LPC Staff will approve the re-creation and restoration of building facade element(s) (including but not limited to roofs and cornices, stoops, storefronts, window and door openings, window and door enframements, ironwork, porches and siding) to their original or historic appearance if they determine that the proposed work satisfies the following conditions:

   (1) The restoration would not cause the removal of original fabric or significant historic fabric (such as Victorian period features on an earlier structure) that may have been added over time, and the authenticity of the restoration is documented by:

      (i) Photographic evidence;

      (ii) Physical evidence on the building;

      (iii) Original or historic drawings or documents; or

      (iv) Matching buildings.

   (2) If there is no available documentary evidence as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the design of the missing feature, including its physical and aesthetic characteristics, may be based on that found on buildings of a similar age and style that contain stylistic elements that follow a set pattern or type, in consultation with LPC Staff. This provision does not apply to Individual Landmarks or buildings seeking or subject to a special permit ("Modification of Use and Bulk" or "MOU").

   (3) Materials for re-creating and restoring missing facade features must match the original or historic materials in kind or be a substitute material that meets the requirements of subdivision (d) of this section.

   (4) The work will not result in the substantial reconstruction of the facade, unless also meeting the requirements of subdivision (e).

(b) General.

   (1) Type of storefront work. This section sets forth criteria and other standards for proposals for new storefronts that are not re-creations or restorations of original or historic storefronts, which instead are addressed in 63 RCNY § 2-11(f).

   (2) Related storefront work. Storefront work often involves other work that is covered by different sections of the Commission's rules. Specifically, applicants for new storefronts and storefront components may also want to consult the following rule sections for the applicable standards:

      (i) Signage. The design and installation of signage and lighting must meet the criteria set forth in 63 RCNY § 2-13.

      (ii) Heating, venting and air-conditioning. The installation of heating, venting and air conditioning equipment and grilles must meet the criteria set forth in 63 RCNY § 2-21.

      (iii) Restoration of storefront facade features. Restoration of storefronts and specific architectural features must meet the criteria set forth in 63 RCNY § 2-11(f).

      (iv) Barrier-free access. Work to make storefronts accessible must meet the criteria set forth in 63 RCNY § 2-18.

   (3) This section does not apply to:

      (i) Individual landmarks, except where specifically indicated.

      (ii) Buildings subject to a building or district master plan, or other special rule approved by the Commission, governing the installation and characteristics of a storefront or awning.

      (iii) Buildings with three or more uniform storefront openings, where the Commission after a Public Hearing already has approved a new storefront but not a storefront master plan

      (iv) Awnings on windows that, due to their shape, size or location, will result in an awning that will detract from the special architectural features of the building.

   (4) No permit is required for the following types of ordinary repair and routine maintenance work on awnings:

      (i) Seasonal removal and installation of Commission approved window awnings;

      (ii) Fabric patching in a matching material;

      (iii) Minor repairs or adjustments to the rolling or folding arm mechanism of an awning's frame; and

      (iv) Cleaning of awning material.

(c) Storefront Infill. LPC Staff will issue an approval for new storefront infill for existing storefront openings, including openings that have been infilled, for buildings in historic districts that were designed with storefronts, and buildings that were altered historically by the construction of ground floor storefronts, and at service entrances as provided in paragraph (7)(iii) of this subdivision, where no significant historic fabric exists, if the proposed work meets all of the relevant criteria set forth below:

   (1) Design. The design of the new infill matches the original or historic appearance determined pursuant to the requirements of 63 RCNY § 2-11(f)(1) or is based on historic storefront prototypes and details within the specific historic district and for buildings of similar age, type and style, except that storefront infill for a building that already has storefront infill approved pursuant to this section must match the previously approved storefront infill in terms of the location, design and materials of piers, the proportions of the elements of storefront infill and finish, but allowing for minor variations in detail and finish. If the building contains three or more uniform storefronts and at least one of the storefronts contains most of its historic elements, a new storefront must match the historic design pursuant to the requirements of 63 RCNY § 2-11(f)(1). Where the historical, architectural or cultural significance of the building or storefront is reflected in changes to the storefront after the initial construction, the new storefront may be required to match the historic appearance as represented by such changes pursuant to the requirements of 63 RCNY § 2-11(f)(1). In all cases the design may be modified to make the storefront meet accessibility requirements.

   (2) Configuration. The configuration of the new infill is consistent with the proportions of display windows, transoms (if necessary, given the size of the display windows) and bulkheads of historic storefront infill.

   (3) Display windows.

      (i) Display windows must be fixed, except that the new infill may consist of operable doors and/or operable windows over a fixed bulkhead provided:

         (A) Operable doors feature bottom rails that match the height, and maintain the design intent, of storefront bulkheads required by subdivision (6) of this section;

         (B) Operable windows are installed over storefront bulkheads required by this section;

         (C) The infill includes either mullions, piers, fixed display windows, or a combination of these elements to avoid creating the appearance of a void at the base of the building when the storefront windows and doors are open; and

         (D) The width of individual operable doors or windows are as large as practicable, and when closed the operable doors or windows will read as display windows over a bulkhead and will maintain a sense of transparency at the base of the building. In the case of a serving window, such window is no larger than fifty (50) percent of the width of the storefront bay, and any mullion or other structural element necessary to accommodate the operable window must match the material and finish of, and be consistent with, the storefront framing; and

      (ii) Glazing in display windows and transoms must be clear, except that a reversible, gray-scale translucent treatment may be applied to the interior face of display window glazing, the lesser of forty-eight (48) inches above the sidewalk or half of the height of the display window, exclusive of transom windows; or to the interior face of a transom window where existing interior conditions preclude the installation of clear transom windows; or where a dropped ceiling or security roll-gate housing is installed in conformance with this section.

   (4) Framing. Storefront framing must feature profiled trim that recalls the articulation of historic storefront framing, and may be a traditional or contemporary type.

   (5) Orientation. New infill must be installed parallel to the building's sidewalk and/or consistent with the plane of the facade and the location of the historic infill, and must be set back from the face of the existing storefront surround the minimum dimension required to avoid concealing any significant architectural feature, including features previously concealed by existing storefront infill, but in no event less than four (4) inches from the face of the storefront surround, unless conditions indicate otherwise.

   (6) Bulkhead. The bulkhead must be between eighteen (18) and thirty (30) inches in height, including a stone or masonry curb, unless the historic storefront prototype indicates a lower or higher bulkhead, in which case the bulkhead may match the height of the historic prototype, and must feature details or materials that recall the articulation of historic storefronts except:

      (i) Where the infill is based on a traditional example or model with paneled bulkheads, the bulkhead must feature panels and stiles, rails, and moldings that match historic prototypes; or

      (ii) Where a limited amount of existing non-original infill is being modified, the new bulkhead may match the existing.

   (7) Entrance and Doors. 

      (i) Recessed entrances may have either splayed or straight returns.

      (ii) The width of the entrance will match the proportions of entryways to display windows found in historic storefronts, and will also meet minimum requirements for accessibility.

      (iii) The design of the new door will maintain the design intent of new entrance infill required by this section, or will be a re-creation or restoration of the original or historic door pursuant to the requirements 63 RCNY § 2-11(f). New infill in service entrances, such as those that historically provided egress or access to freight elevators or had other utilitarian uses and were not historically used for storefronts or residential entrances, may vary in design, configuration and material in keeping with similar service entrances found in the particular historic district where the installation occurs. Alternatively, provided there is no significant historic fabric, a service entrance that was not a garage opening or loading bay for vehicles, may be removed and replaced with a storefront entrance, display window or other storefront infill pursuant to this section.

   (8) Material. If the building was constructed prior to 1900, the material of the new infill must either match the historic material, if known, or be wood; for buildings constructed in or after 1900, or built before and altered in or after 1900 to include storefronts, the material of the new infill may be wood or metal or match the historic material.

   (9) Finish. New storefront infill must have a finish that recalls the finish of historic storefronts.

   (10) Interior Partitions and/or Built-In Features. Interior partitions, built-in features and vitrines built parallel to a display window must be a minimum of eighteen (18) inches behind the glass of the display window and:

      (i) Have a surface area that blocks no more than fifty (50) percent of the area of the display window (exclusive of the transom), not including dropped soffits;

      (ii) Have an interior quality finish and/or materials on the street facing side and feature non-illuminated, or indirectly illuminated display(s) of graphics or merchandise;

      (iii) Are limited to a first floor storefront, except a partition or built-in feature may also be allowed at second story storefronts of commercial buildings;

      (iv) Where such partition or built-in feature is a free-standing partition or vitrine within the display window below the transom, the horizontal dimension shall not block more than seventy-five (75) percent of the width of the display window; and

      (v) Dropped soffits at the ceiling may be no closer than twelve (12) inches to the glass of the display or transom window and may be dropped the minimum distance necessary to address the structural or other issues requiring such dropped soffit.

   (11) Piers. If original or historic piers have been previously removed, the design must include the restoration of the piers or the introduction of features that recall the location, size, and dimension of such piers.

   (12) Removal of modern cladding. If an applicant is proposing to remove modern cladding on the storefront or the area surrounding the storefront, the applicant must first perform probes of the material to see if historic material or elements exist behind the modern cladding.

      (i) If significant historic storefront material or elements exists underneath the cladding, the historic material must be restored and the new storefront can only be approved pursuant to 63 RCNY § 2-11(f).

      (ii) If a significant portion of the historic storefront surround exists underneath the cladding, but no historic storefront infill remains, the storefront surround must be restored, pursuant to 63 RCNY § 2-11(f), as part of the application for new storefront infill under this paragraph.

   (13) Restoration of the original storefront opening. If the original storefront opening has been reduced or increased in size the design must include the restoration of the height and width of the original opening, except that:

      (i) The existing storefront opening may be maintained where the size and organization of storefront bays and entrances were altered in a way that is consistent with other buildings within the historic district that include storefronts, or

      (ii) Where interior conditions preclude restoration to the original height (e.g., later structural elements or existing interior roll-gate housing or mechanical systems) the existing storefront opening shall be enlarged or reduced to the greatest extent feasible, and:

         (A) The design of the surround is consistent with the materials and details of the historic base of the building; and

         (B) If necessary, given the size of the display windows, the design features an opaque glazed transom window.

   (14) New door and door opening. A new door opening and door may be constructed to provide access to an existing storefront where:

      (i) The new door is on the same facade and in close proximity to an existing storefront display window;

      (ii) The new door opening will be installed in non-historic storefront infill or through plain brick;

      (iii) The width of the new door opening is the minimum necessary to provide for a door that meets accessibility requirements and, if needed, sidelight, and the height of the door opening is aligned with the height or the storefront or other storefront feature and does not call undue attention to itself; and

      (iv) The design of the new door is consistent with existing storefront doors or is consistent with the criteria for a replacement door.

   (15) Security gates. LPC Staff may approve an application for roll-down security gates and grilles on proposed storefronts where:

      (i) The security gate is located behind the storefront infill and the gate is open mesh where it covers glazed areas; or

      (ii) If the roll-down security gate is mounted so that the gate rolls down on the exterior side of the display window and door:

         (A) The installation does not affect, obscure or damage historic fabric;

         (B) The housing for the roll-down security gates is installed so as not to protrude, or protrudes the least amount feasible, beyond the face of the storefront display window or transom, and it is finished to match the storefront framing;

         (C) The security gate tracks are recessed or set into reveals along the sides of the storefront; and

         (D) The security gate is open mesh where it covers glazed areas of the storefront.

(d) Awnings and Canopies at Commercial Storefronts and at Residential and Other Buildings.

   (1) Recladding and retention of existing awnings and sidewalk canopies.

      (i) LPC Staff will issue a Certificate of No Effect or a Permit for Minor Work for recladding existing awnings and sidewalk canopies if the proposed recladding meets both of the following criteria:

         (A) The awning or canopy was present at the time of designation or was previously approved by an LPC permit; and

         (B) The existing frame will be reclad in a material and finish that conforms to the criteria set forth in subdivision (d)(2)(vii)-(ix) or (d)(3)(ix)-(xi) of this section.

      (ii) If a new storefront is being installed, an existing storefront awning or canopy in noncompliance with the criteria set forth in paragraph(3) below cannot be retained unless the applicant can demonstrate to LPC Staff that the new storefront installation will not require even the temporary removal of the existing awning or canopy.

   (2) Installation of new awnings on windows, doors and porches that are not associated with storefronts. LPC Staff will issue a Certificate of No Effect or a Permit for Minor Work for new awnings on residential windows, doors and porches if the proposed awning meets all of the following criteria applicable for such installation:

      (i) Awnings installed on residential windows, doors and porches will be either retractable or fixed.

      (ii) Awnings will be installed at or below the lintel, or within the window opening, as close to the top of the window as feasible, and will conform to the size and shape of the window or door opening.

      (iii) The attachment of the awning will not cause the loss of, damage to, or hide or obscure any significant feature.

      (iv) Awnings will project at an angle and be of a length, size and slope which are proportional to the size and height of the window or door.

      (v) Awnings at occupiable terraces and architectural setbacks above the ground floor may extend over more than one opening, so long as the overall length of the awning is proportional to the size and length of the terrace or setback and the depth does not exceed the depth of the terrace or setback.

      (vi) Awnings on porches will conform to the bay structure and proportions of the porch.

      (vii) All awnings on a building or portions of a mixed use building that are not associated with storefronts must match in terms of fabric color and pattern if installed on primary or visible secondary facades.

      (ix) Awning fabric will consist of a solid color or vertical stripes that harmonize with the historic color palette of the building. No lettering or signage is permitted on awnings that are not associated with storefronts except for an address number on an awning over an entrance, and the numbers of such address must be no greater than six inches in height.

   (3) Installation of new awnings on storefronts, display windows and doorways. LPC Staff will issue a Certificate of No Effect or a Permit for Minor Work for new awnings on ground story storefronts, ground or second story display windows, and doorways if the proposed work meets all of the following criteria applicable for such installation:

      (i) The awning must be retractable on buildings which were designed with integral retractable awning housings as part of the storefronts. In all other cases, the awning may be either retractable or fixed. If fixed, the awning must have a straight slope and be open at the sides. If retractable, the awning must have a straight or curved slope and may or may not have side panels. Retractable awnings may follow the curved configuration of the window or door opening over which they are installed. If a display window or doorway opening has an arched or segmental head, the awning must be retractable if it is installed at the head of the window, but may be fixed if it is installed at the rectilinear transom bar. Both retractable and fixed awnings may or may not have a skirt. Awning skirts must be unframed. The skirt height must be proportional to the height and size of the awning, but cannot be greater than twelve (12) inches.

      (ii) The attachment of the awning will not cause the loss of, damage to, or hide or obscure any significant feature.

      (iii) The awning will be installed within the storefront opening, surround or enframement, or, if that is not possible, at or directly below or above the lintel or transom bar, except that the awning may be attached above the lintel where:

         (A) a roll-down security gate that either was present at the time of designation or was previously approved by the Commission makes it impossible to install the awning at the lintel or transom bar; or

         (B) installing the awning at the lintel or transom bar will result in the lowest framed portion of the awning being less than eight feet above the sidewalk, and

         (C) where the awning is installed above the lintel, the awning encroachment above the lintel will be the minimum required to accommodate the conditions described above in clauses (A) and (B), and will not detract from the significant architectural features of the storefront, building or, where relevant, historic district.

      (iv) In cases where the storefront itself projects from the facade, the awning will be attached to the projecting storefront below the storefront cornice or cap.

      (v) The length of the awning will not exceed the length of the storefront opening or the associated window opening, and the edges of the awning shall be aligned as closely as possible with the inside face of the principal piers of the storefront, or the window or door opening.

*§ 2-13 Signage.* ::


(a) Introduction. Signage was a typical feature of historic buildings that contained commercial or manufacturing uses. Such signage included signs painted or affixed above storefronts in signbands, signs within display windows, bracket signs, and signs hanging from underneath canopies. This rule sets forth the requirements for LPC Staff approval of some types of storefront signage and associated lighting for such signage. All proposals for signage not seeking a discretionary approval from another City agency must comply with the Zoning Resolution in terms of size, placement, projection and illumination.

(b) Definitions. As used in this 63 RCNY § 2-13, the following words have the following meanings:

   Armature. "Armature" means a metal structural support for a rigid projecting sign. The armature may support the bracket sign by means of one or two projecting arms, or may be flush mounted with a sleeve and/or concealed.

   Bracket Sign. "Bracket Sign" means a rigid outdoor sign, with two display faces, installed perpendicular to a building facade and attached to an armature, used as an announcement for an establishment in the building, consisting of the rigid display faces and all letters, words, numerals, illustrations, decorations, trademarks, emblems, symbols or their figures or characters associated with the name of the establishment that are applied to the faces. In addition, a bracket sign may consist solely of an outline of a shape and/or letters intended to act as a symbol or sign for the establishment.

   Canopy means a metal frame clad with fabric that extends from a building entrance over the sidewalk to the curb, where it is supported on vertical posts.

   CNE. "CNE" means Certificate of No Effect as defined by § 25-306 of the New York City Administrative Code.

   Sign means a fixture or area containing lettering or graphics used to advertise a store, goods, or services.

   Signage means any lettering or other graphics used to advertise a store, goods, or services.

   Signband means the flat, horizontal area on the facade, usually located immediately above the storefront and below the second story window sill where signs were historically attached. Signbands can also be found immediately above the storefront display window, but below the masonry opening's lintel. A signband shall not include the frieze of a cornice that is less than 12" in height. A signband may exist above a second story storefront.

   Significant architectural feature means an exterior architectural component of a building that contributes to or reinforces its special historic, cultural, and aesthetic character.

   Storefront means the first or second story area of the facade that provides access or natural illumination into a space used for retail or other commercial purposes.

   Storefront opening means the area of the facade between the piers and lintel, which contains storefront infill.

   Transom means a glazed area above a display window or door that is separated from the display window or door by a horizontal framing member ("the transom bar"). The glazing in the transom may be fixed or operable.

(c) Installation of Storefront Signs. The LPC Staff will issue a CNE or PMW for a storefront sign, other than a bracket sign, if the proposed work meets the relevant criteria listed below:

   (1) The signage is as-of-right pursuant to the Zoning Resolution and the Building Code.

   (2) The installation of signage will not damage, destroy or obscure significant architectural features or material of the building or storefront.

   (3) Signs will be installed in the signband above a storefront opening or within the storefront opening.

   (4) Signs will include dimensional letters and logos composed of wood or metal, or painted plastic, that project no more than two inches if installed directly into masonry or wood signbands, or directly on wood, metal, or opaque glass sign panels mounted flat with the signband, or painted directly onto the ground floor signband and lintels. Pin mounted letters requiring numerous attachments points to historic masonry signbands should utilize mounting strips where feasible, and will not be allowed in any instance on cast iron.

   (5) Flat sign panels will project no more than 2 inches from the facade, and dimensional letters on sign panels will project no more than 2 inches beyond the panel for a total projection of four (4) inches from the facade. In the case of dimensional letters installed on a metal channel within a transom, the channel may be straight or slightly bowed, and the letters will not project beyond the plane of the facade, and will be no larger than 18 inches and in no event higher than the height of the transom glass, and the channel will be no more than 1 inch tall. LPC Staff will not approve both a sign in the signband and a sign on a metal channel within a transom.

   (6) The sign will be proportional to the signband, but in no event will it exceed 90 percent of the area of the signband and the letters will not be higher than eighteen (18) inches in total whether one or two lines of text is used.

   (7) Signage mounted on the exterior will not be internally illuminated, except that it may be "halo" lit with a light source behind opaque letters.

Non-concealed illuminated lighting strips outlining the display window will not be permitted. Any other illuminated signage must be at least eighteen (18) inches set back from the inside plane of the glass of the display window or transom.

   (9) Painted and vinyl signage may be applied directly onto the storefront glazing, including glazing at the doors, transom and display window, provided that the signage does not exceed more than twenty (20) percent of the glazed area. For purposes of this paragraph, the percent of the glazed area covered by signage will be calculated by the total area of the sign as a visual object and the collective groupings of text and images, without subtracting for voids between letters, numbers or graphics.

   (10) Signage installed on the exterior may be illuminated externally with a shielded source of light, including "halo" lit with a light source behind opaque letters, or with a small projecting fixture twelve (12) inches or less in length or width placed above the sign, with a maximum number of fixtures as follows: one fixture for the first one to six (1 - 6) feet of storefront opening; two fixtures if the storefront opening is between six to twelve (6 - 12) feet; three fixtures if the storefront opening is between twelve to eighteen (12 - 18) feet; and four fixtures if the storefront opening is between eighteen to twenty-four (18 - 24) feet. In no event will the light fixture arm project more than eighteen (18) inches from the sign. Cove fixtures must have the same finish as the sign, and if the sign projects from the facade, the cove fixture must be an integral part of the sign.

   (11) Light fixtures will be installed in areas of plain masonry, metal, or wood, provided that the installation does not damage, destroy, or obscure significant architectural features of the building or storefront.

   (14) In approving an application for signage the LPC Staff will consider the overall amount of approved and grandfathered signage for the storefront and building. If the LPC Staff determines that the overall amount of signage for the storefront or building is excessive and will detract from the architectural features of the building, the adjacent buildings, or the streetscape, the staff will require that existing or proposed staff approved signage be eliminated or reduced. Such signage includes but not limited to signs on awning skirts, signage in a signband, signage applied to the storefront glazing, and bracket signs. LPC Staff will not approve new signage that will result in a storefront having a sign in the signband, signage on an awning, signage in a storefront and a bracket sign.

(d) Installation of Bracket Signs. The LPC Staff will issue a CNE for a bracket sign if the proposed work meets all of the following criteria:

   (1) The armature will be installed below the second story, or above the second story at the lowest point to meet the minimum height criteria of the Zoning Resolution, within the storefront opening or on the flat face of a plain masonry, wood or metal pier, but not including cast iron, and will be mechanically fastened into the storefront infill or into the mortar joints of a plain masonry pier, or attached to the framing members at the underside of a metal canopy on an industrial building, and such installation will neither damage nor conceal any significant architectural features of the building.

   (2) The armature will be a metal finished to be harmonious with the storefront finish, and will be simply designed.

   (3) The display faces of the bracket sign may be made of wood or metal. If the bracket sign has display faces, the letters, words, numerals, illustrations or graphics may be painted or applied onto the display faces, and may be raised slightly from the surface. Any raised features, including letters, words, numerals, illustrations or graphics, must be made of wood or metal, or painted plastic. The overall width, as measured from face to face, will not exceed two (2) inches, and, if there are raised features the bracket sign shall not exceed a width of three inches as measured from the outside plane of such raised features. The display faces and the letters, words, numerals, illustrations or graphics, whether raised or not, will be of a color or colors that do not detract from the significant architectural features of the building or neighboring buildings. No neon or other vividly bright colors will be permitted.

   (4) The bracket sign will not be internally illuminated, but the display faces may be externally illuminated by a lighting fixture that is integral or attached to the sign or armature, is, if not concealed, as small and discrete as possible and does not call attention to itself, and is finished to blend with the sign or armature.

   (5) The bracket sign will be fixed or may move freely from its points of attachment to the armature, but in no event will the bracket sign be made to move by mechanized or controlled means.

   (6) Number of bracket signs for ground floor establishments.

      (i) Except for signs subject to subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) below, one bracket sign per ground floor establishment will be permitted.

      (ii) In buildings with more than one ground floor establishment, one sign per establishment may be installed, provided that there is no more than two signs per twenty (20) feet of building facade fronting on a street, and further provided that the size, design, placement, materials and details of all of the armatures match or are similar. The placement of the bracket sign on the building will be in close proximity to the establishment that is identified on the bracket sign.

      (iii) A ground floor establishment with a corner storefront may have one bracket sign on each building facade with at least twenty (20) feet of street frontage, provided that each facade has a primary entrance and each bracket sign is located in close proximity to an entrance, but in no event will more than one bracket sign be located within twenty (20) feet of the corner of the building.

   (7) Bracket signs for upper story establishments. A single armature for a bracket sign for an upper story establishment or establishments may be installed adjacent to the building entrance for such upper story establishments. This armature may hold one sign for each upper story establishment, provided such signs hang vertically underneath one another on the same armature, and further provided that in no event will the total dimensions of such signs, taken together, exceed the size requirements specified in paragraph (8) below.

   (8) The size of the bracket sign, oriented horizontally or vertically, will conform to the requirements of the Zoning Resolution, but in no event will the size exceed twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-six (36) inches in districts that were historically manufacturing or industrial in character, eighteen (18) inches by twenty-four (24) inches in districts that were historically commercial, or twelve (12) inches by eighteen (18) inches in districts that were historically residential in character. Novelty shapes, such as circles, polygons and irregular shapes are permitted, as are novelty objects, provided such shapes and objects generally fall within the parameters described in this paragraph.

   (9) The projection of the bracket sign and armature beyond the property line will conform to the requirements of the Zoning Resolution and Building Code, but in no event shall extend more than 40 inches from the facade in districts that were historically manufacturing or industrial in character, eighteen (18) inches in districts that were historically commercial, and no more than twelve (12) inches in districts that were historically residential in character.

   (10) The bracket sign will be installed so that the lowest portion of the sign is at least ten (10) feet above the sidewalk.

   (11) The establishment seeking approval for a bracket sign is not, for the same building, already utilizing an LPC-approved, grandfathered or unapproved flagpole and banner, nor will it have approval from the LPC for installing a new flagpole and banner on the same building.

   (12) In approving an application for a bracket sign, LPC Staff will consider the overall amount of approved and grandfathered signage for the storefront and building. If the Staff determines that the overall amount of signage for the storefront or building is excessive and will detract from the architectural features of the building, adjacent buildings or streetscape the Staff will require that other types of existing or proposed staff approved or approvable signage, including but not limited to signs on awning skirts and signage applied to the storefront glazing, be eliminated or reduced.

(e) Signage for Commercial Spaces Below the Sidewalk. Where a commercial establishment has an entrance below the sidewalk level, LPC staff will issue an approval for a sign that is installed:

   (1) On a plain masonry band above the storefront opening, if one exists, and provided the signage otherwise meets the criteria set forth in subdivision (c); or

      (i) The work is not occurring in an Interior Landmark;

      (ii) The interior add-ons have no mullions, muntins or wide frames that are conspicuous as seen through the glazing of the primary window or door from the exterior of the building;

      (iii) The interior add-ons have clear glass or clear acrylic (including plexiglass) or screens with a dark fabric; and/or

      (iv) The add-on is an applied film and is clear.

   (3) Interior and exterior add-ons at non-visible facades. New interior and exterior window and door add-ons at non-visible portions of secondary facades if the work is not occurring in an Interior Landmark and no significant exterior architectural feature of the window, door or building will be lost or damaged.

(d) Installation of Exterior Add-Ons for Windows and Doors in Individual Landmarks and Buildings in Historic Districts and Scenic Landmarks. 

   (1) Storm windows and doors and screens. LPC Staff may approve an application for new exterior window and door add-ons at primary facades and visible portions of secondary facades, provided the work meets all of the following criteria applicable to such work:

      (i) The add-on fits tightly within the window or door opening with minimal or no sub-frame around the perimeter, and is set as far back from the plane of the exterior wall as possible;

      (ii) The add-on will be made of wood, metal or fiberglass with a finish that matches the color of the primary window or door frame, with clear glass;

      (iii) A window add-on will have horizontal mullions or meeting rails that match the primary window's meeting rail or substantial mullions, is placed in the same relative location, with no additional divisions;

      (iv) A door add-on will have horizontal mullions only in conjunction with the rails of the primary door, with no additional divisions; and

      (v) The installation of the add-on will not damage or destroy any significant feature of the window, door or building.

   (2) Applied films. LPC Staff may approve an application for applied films on windows or doors at primary facades and visible portions of secondary facades, provided the work meets all of the following criteria applicable to such work:

      (i) The applied film is clear or translucent and/or tinted in greyscale, except that only clear film may be used for special windows or doors;

      (ii) The installation is on the interior face of the glass and is reversible; and

      (iii) If translucent and/or tinted, the overall installation is limited in scope so as to not change the character of the overall fenestration of the building (for example, applied only at bathroom windows).

(e) Special Windows and Special Doors; Any Facade.

   (1) If existing original or historic special windows or special doors are deteriorated beyond reasonable repair, as described in a condition assessment submitted by the applicant, new windows or doors may be approved if they match the original or historic windows and doors in terms of details, materials, operation, configuration and finish. The assessment should generally be prepared by a qualified architect or engineer; however, for more limited scopes of work a contractor or other professional with preservation experience may be deemed acceptable. For purposes of this subdivision, the criteria established for window replacement at Primary Facades of Individual Landmarks will be used, with the additional variations and exceptions as described in paragraph (f)(1).

   (2) A window that is special due only to its glazing can be removed and reinstalled in a new window sash that otherwise complies with the relevant criteria for replacement of non-special windows.

(f) Primary Facades. 

   (1) General criteria. New windows or doors may be approved if they match the original or historic windows and doors in terms of details, materials, operation, configuration and finish. Historic doors may be replaced only if they are deteriorated beyond reasonable repair, as described in a condition assessment. For purposes of this subdivision, the following variations and exceptions apply, except as noted in each provision.

      (i) Details. Variations in details will be permitted if such variations do not significantly affect the visual characteristics of the window or door. LPC Staff may approve a diminution of glazing area from the historic window not to exceed ten (10) percent for metal windows and six (6) percent for wood windows, except that the diminution percentages may be slightly exceeded for specific window types due to their small size or muntin pattern, or due to building, energy, accessibility or other code requirements that must be met, provided that LPC Staff determines that the proposed window will not call attention to itself or detract from the significant architectural features of the building. In addition to the window sashes, door leafs and frames, the new window's or door's muntins, mullions and brickmolds must also match the historic condition. Simulated divided light ("SDL") muntins are acceptable substitutes for true divided light muntins, provided the exterior muntins are built into the frames of the sashes and are of the same material and there are spacers between multiple layers of glass and interior muntins. At large residential and commercial buildings in historic districts, spacers and interior muntins are not required.

      (ii) Materials.

         (A) A historic wood window or door can be replaced with wood of any species. A historic metal window or door can be replaced with a different metal, including replacing metal-clad windows with a non-metal substrate material. However, Special Windows and Special Doors may require matching the original material exactly.

         (B) At small residential and commercial buildings in historic districts, straight- and arch-headed, double-hung wood windows for which the historic condition had no divided lights (without muntins) may be replaced with windows of a different material, including aluminum and fiberglass, but not including vinyl, provided the historic wood brickmolds are retained or replicated in wood, aluminum or fiberglass; the new windows are installed in the same plane as the historic window; and the window and brickmolds have a matching finish that replicates the historic finish;

         (C) If the historic transom window originally or historically had stained or leaded glass but did not retain such glass at the time of designation, the replacement window does not have to match the stained glass but can be either clear glass or recall the stained or leaded glass window.

      (iii) Operation.

         (A) The upper sash of a double-hung window, or of a transom window, may be fixed, and the direction of the swing (e.g., outward or inward) of a casement, awning or hopper window may be changed.

         (B) Except at Individual Landmarks, the historic operation of the lower sash of a double-hung window may be changed to a hinged operation to meet high-performance energy-efficiency or accessibility standards or goals provided that:

            (a) The operation of the lower sash is limited to an inward tilting hopper for ventilation, except for additional inward turning capabilities for maintenance purposes only, and the plane of the lower sash approximates that of the historic sash;

            (b) The details closely match that of the historic double-hung window, with additional dimensional tolerances (typically deeper sashes and frames) to accommodate thicker insulated glazing and the change in operation at the lower sash, and such additional minor changes do not call attention to themselves or detract from the appearance of the building or adjacent buildings, if in a district; and

            (c) All windows on the primary facades eligible for this exception, excluding special windows, are being replaced at the same time or as part of an approved master plan to ensure a uniform installation and appearance.

         (C) The operation of a door must match the historic operation, except that the historic operation of a swinging door may be changed to fixed or reversed in swing or hinging; in addition, the historic operation of a swinging, sliding, roll-down or overhead garage or loading door may be substituted interchangeably;

         (D) Except at Individual Landmarks, the historic operation of a pivot window may be changed to a hinged operation matching the vertical or horizontal orientation of the pivot operation; and

      (iv) Configuration of a door. The following exception to matching the configuration of a historic door may apply if the door is not a Special Door or located on an Individual Landmark: the historic configuration of equal leaf paired doors may be changed to unequal leafs or a single leaf, if the applicant can demonstrate an inability to meet accessibility requirements through other modifications, provided that the new door(s) will match or recall the configuration and details of the historic door(s), and the work meets other relevant criteria in 63 RCNY § 2-18.

   (2) Specific criteria for primary facades.

      (i) Individual Landmarks.

         (A) Existing original or historic window and door openings. If original or historic windows or doors are deteriorated beyond reasonable repair due to physical conditions as described in a condition assessment submitted by the applicant, new windows or doors will be approved if they match the original or historic windows and doors in terms of configuration, operation, details, material and finish. The assessment should generally be prepared by a qualified architect or engineer; however, for more limited scopes of work a contractor or other professional with preservation experience may be deemed acceptable.

         (B) Existing non-original or non-historic window and door openings. If the window or door opening is not original or historic, or has been substantially modified, such as a window opening installed after the removal of a stoop and entrance door, or a door opening installed after the installation of a fire escape, a new window or door may be approved if it matches or otherwise harmonizes with the configuration, details and materials of the original or historic windows and doors on the building.

      (ii) Small residential and commercial buildings in historic districts.

         (A) Applicability. For purposes of this subparagraph, a small residential or commercial building is a building which is six stories or less in height and has a street frontage of forty (40) feet or less, and includes rowhouses, townhouses, mansions, detached and semi-detached houses and carriage houses; small apartment buildings, tenements and hotels; and small, utilitarian, commercial and loft buildings, including cast-iron fronted buildings, department stores, banks and office buildings. Notwithstanding the above, a corner rowhouse, town house, mansion, detached and semi-detached house and carriage house shall be deemed a small residential and commercial building regardless of the length of its longest street frontage.

         (B) Existing original or historic window and door openings. New windows installed in existing original or historic openings will be approved if they match the historic windows in terms of configuration, operation, details, material and finish. If original or historic doors are deteriorated beyond reasonable repair due to physical conditions as described in a condition assessment submitted by the applicant, new doors replacing historic doors will be approved if they match the historic doors in terms of configuration, operation, details, material and finish, and new doors replacing non-historic doors will be approved if they match the historic doors in terms of operation, material and finish, and recall the configuration and details of the historic doors. The assessment should generally be prepared by a qualified architect or engineer, however for more limited scopes of work a contractor or other professional with preservation experience may be deemed acceptable.

         (C) Existing non-original or non-historic window and door openings. If the existing window or door opening is not original or historic, or has been substantially modified, such as a window opening installed after the removal of a stoop and entrance door, or a door opening installed after the installation of a fire escape, the new window or door will be approved if it matches, or otherwise harmonizes with, the configuration, operation, details, material and finish of the historic windows and doors on the building. The design may maintain the existing opening or may include the modification of the height and width of the existing opening, and may introduce new architectural features on the area surrounding the opening, provided that:

            (a) The design of the surround is consistent with or harmonious the materials and details of the building.

            (b) For modifications to entrances at the base of the building, see 63 RCNY § 2-14(i).

         (B) Existing original or historic window and door openings. New windows installed in existing original or historic openings will be approved if they match the historic windows in terms of configuration, operation, details and finish. New doors installed in existing original or historic openings will be approved if they recall the historic doors in terms of configuration, operation, details and finish.

         (C) Existing non-original or non-historic window and door openings. If the existing window or door opening is not original or historic, or has been substantially modified, such as a window opening installed after the removal of a stoop and entrance door, or a door opening installed after the installation of a fire escape, the new window or door will be approved if it matches, or otherwise harmonizes with, the configuration, operation, details, material and finish of the historic windows and doors on the building. The design may maintain the existing opening or may include the modification of the height and width of the existing opening, and may introduce new architectural features on the area surrounding the opening, provided that:

            (a) The design of the surround is consistent or harmonious with the materials and details of the building.

            (b) For modifications to entrances at the base of the building, see 63 RCNY § 2-14(i).

      (iv) Other buildings in historic districts.

         (A) Applicability. For purposes of this subparagraph, "other buildings" include buildings such as churches and synagogues, hospitals, schools, libraries and the one- or two-story commercial building known as a "taxpayer."

         (B) Existing original or historic window and door openings. New windows and doors installed in existing original or historic openings will be approved if they satisfy the criteria in set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (f) as determined by whether the other building type is seven or more stories in height or has more than forty (40) feet of street frontage.

         (C) Existing non-original or non-historic window and door openings. If the existing window or door opening is not original or historic, or has been substantially modified, such as a window opening installed after the removal of a stoop and entrance door, or a door opening installed after the installation of a fire escape, the new window or door will be approved if it matches or otherwise harmonizes with the configuration, details, material and finish of the historic windows and doors on the building. The design may maintain the existing opening or may include the modification of the height and width of the existing opening, and may introduce new architectural features on the area surrounding the opening, provided that:

            (a) The design of the surround is consistent or harmonious with the materials and details of the building.

            (b) For modifications to entrances at the base of the building, see 63 RCNY § 2-14(i).

      (v) Buildings in Scenic Landmarks.

         (A) Applicability. This subparagraph shall apply to buildings in Scenic Landmarks that are not Individual Landmarks, and shall include such buildings as educational centers, sports-related buildings, utility buildings (including sheds and maintenance buildings), stables, carriage houses, garages, boat houses, historic houses, police stations, zoo buildings, theater and performance buildings, and comfort stations.

         (B) Existing original or historic window and door openings. New windows and doors installed in existing original or historic openings will be approved if they satisfy the criteria in set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (f) as follows: buildings six or less stories in height and with less than forty (40) feet of primary facade shall follow the criteria in paragraph (2)(ii) of subdivision (f), and shall follow the criteria in paragraph (2)(iii) of subdivision (f) if taller or with more than forty (40) feet of primary facade.

(g) Secondary Facades; Visible Facades. This subdivision applies to new windows and doors, and modified and new window and door openings, at visible portions of secondary facades for all building types.

   (1) Existing window and door openings. New windows and doors installed in existing openings, whether original, historic or modified, will be approved if they match the historic windows and doors in terms of configuration and finish.

      (i) Existing window and door openings that do not contain a special window or door can be filled in provided:

         (A) If the facade is masonry, the window and door opening will be filled in with new masonry to match the surrounding masonry, except if an original or historic window opening is being filled in, the new masonry must be set flush with but not toothed into the surrounding masonry, or set slightly back of the plane of the facade, and the lintel and sill retained, provided that the filled in openings will not detract from the existing windows or doors on the secondary facade or the primary facade if such filled in windows can be seen in conjunction with the primary facade. Notwithstanding the foregoing, original or historic window openings at the top floor of a building built as part of a row of identical or similar buildings, where the building retains its original height, cannot be filled in.

         (B) If the facade is sided with wood, the window or door opening can be filled in with wood to match the existing facade, except at the top floor of a building that was built as part of a row.

   (2) Modified and new window and door openings. New windows and doors installed in existing openings being modified by enlarging or reducing the opening in height and/or width, or new windows and doors installed in newly created openings, on visible portions of secondary facades will be approved if the modified or new opening, and the window or door, meet all of the following criteria as applicable:

      (i) Modified and new window and door openings.

         (A) A modified or newly created window or door opening will retain the same general shape and pattern as existing windows and doors on the same facade, or, where there are no existing openings, the newly created opening will be located in a place and be of a size and shape where it can form the basis for a regular and consistent pattern; and that the number, size or placement of the new window or door opening does not change the character of the facade as a secondary and subservient facade with a high solid to void ratio;

            (a) With respect to proposals for creating new window or door openings at secondary facades of row houses or townhouses, mansions, detached and semi-detached houses and carriage houses, staff may approve new window openings provided that, together with the existing openings, there is no more than one window opening on a secondary facade of less than twenty (20) feet, two window openings if the facade is between twenty-one (21) and forty (40) feet, and 3 window openings if more than forty (40) feet; the placement, pattern and sizes of windows on the facade do not detract from significant architectural features of the buildings or neighboring buildings if in a district; and the original window openings on the top floor of a rear facade are not modified, with the exception of one window opening which may be lowered to provide access to an approved or grandfathered balcony, terrace or deck. However, previously altered window openings on the top floor of these building types may be enlarged or reduced to restore or more closely match the original window openings, as deemed appropriate by LPC Staff.

            (b) No opening with a special window or door may be modified.

      (ii) New windows and doors installed in modified and new window and door openings approved pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph will be approved if they match the historic windows and doors in terms of configuration and finish, and

         (A) The new window or door will not replace a Special Window or Special Door;

         (B) The new and/or modified window or door opening, and window or door, will not detract from the significant architectural features of the building or adjacent buildings by virtue of their proximity to such features.

(h) Secondary Facades; Nonvisible and Minimally Visible Facades. New and modified window and door openings, and new windows and doors installed in existing openings, new openings, and modified openings will be approved if the proposed work meets all of the following relevant criteria:

   (1) New windows and doors in existing openings.

      (i) LPC Staff will approve a new window or door in an existing opening, provided the window or door being removed is not a special window or special door, except that if the "Special Window" is limited to distinctive glazing, the glazing can be removed and installed in a new window and in a new location on the facade;

      (ii) Existing window and door openings that do not contain a special window or door can be filled in with new masonry to match the surrounding masonry or filled in with new facade cladding to match the surrounding facade cladding for non-masonry facades, except at the top floor of a building built as part of a row or identical or similar buildings where the building retains its historic height, and provided that the filled in opening does not detract from the existing windows or doors on the secondary facade. One (1) original or historic window opening at the top floor of a building built as part of a row may be filled in, if the new masonry is set slightly back of the plane of the facade and the lintel and sill are retained.

   (2) Modified window and door openings.

      (i) Existing window and door openings on the same floor, except as provided below for the top floor and bottom two floors, may be modified by enlarging or reducing the opening in height and/or width or combining horizontally adjacent openings, provided that at least one bay of windows is not combined and the modified opening maintains the existing masonry wall or cladding at the outer piers, other mullions or muntins break down the scale of the window and the enlarged opening does not extend above or below a floor, and there are at least eighteen (18) inches between the enlarged opening and the windows above and below;

         (A) With respect to the top floor, the historic window openings cannot be modified except that one window opening may be lowered to provide access to an approved or grandfathered balcony, terrace or deck, including a new Juliette-style balcony, and the modified window opening may be widened if necessary to meet minimum code requirements;

         (B) With respect to the bottom two floor levels of the existing building, a modified window and door opening can combine all windows and doors on a floor, and may span vertically between the bottom two floor levels to create a single large opening, if the modified opening will maintain at least twenty-four (24) inches of masonry or wall cladding at the outer piers and between the floors above the modified opening, and provided there is a spandrel or horizontal element of at least twelve (12) inches that marks the location of the missing floor and other mullions or muntins that break down the scale of the window, except that if the modified window is to be installed in an addition or extension that does not extend the full width of the building, 12 (twelve) inches of masonry or wall cladding must remain at the outer piers; and

      (ii) At intersecting facades, such as those occurring at partial rear extensions, modified and enlarged openings may not wrap continuously around the outside or inside corners and must maintain at least 12 (twelve) inches of separation with masonry or wall cladding.

   (3) New window and door openings. The new opening must:

      (i) Match or be consistent with the size and scale of existing openings and placed so as to be consistent with an existing pattern or to create a consistent pattern; or

      (ii) Match or be consistent with the modifications to existing window and door openings provided for in this section; and

      (iii) Not detract from significant architectural features of the building or adjacent buildings.

   (4) New windows and doors in modified existing openings and in new openings. LPC Staff will approve new windows and doors to be installed in new openings and existing openings modified as permitted under this subsection, provided that:

      (i) The new window or door does not detract from any significant exterior architectural feature of the building or neighboring buildings by virtue of its proximity to such feature(s); and

      (ii) If the opening has been widened, combined horizontally and/or vertically, the new windows and doors are subdivided to give the window scale and texture and, for purposes of this subparagraph, sliding glass doors may be installed in a modified or new opening if the opening faces onto a deck or the ground.

   (5) For purposes of this subdivision (h), a secondary facade is "minimally visible" if the facade is seen at such an angle that the configuration of the windows cannot be seen or is very difficult to discern, or only a small portion of the facade is seen through a gap in the streetwall and is visually disconnected from the primary facade of the building.

(i) Entrance Infill, Excluding Entrances in Storefront Infill. LPC Staff will issue an approval for new entrance infill for existing entrance openings (e.g., at primary and secondary entries for lobbies, vestibules, service areas or egress), but not including entrance openings in Individual Landmarks, where no significant historic fabric exists, if the proposed work will restore the historic infill pursuant to the requirements of 63 RCNY § 2-11(f) or meets all of the relevant criteria set forth below:

   (1) Design. The design of the new infill is based on the historic entrance prototypes and details within the specific historic district and for buildings of similar age, type and style, except that entrance infill for a building that already has entrance infill approved pursuant to this section must be harmonious with the previously approved entrance infill in terms of the design, materials and finish. At commercial and mixed-use buildings where entrance infill and storefront infill was installed in similar openings historically, the entrance infill can also be removed and replaced with storefront infill pursuant to 63 RCNY § 2-12(c).

   (2) Configuration. The configuration of the new infill is consistent with the proportions of doors, sidelights, transoms and other features of historic entrance infill or previously approved entrance infill.

   (3) Door, transom and sidelight glazing. Glazing in doors, transoms and sidelights must be clear, except that a gray-scale translucent treatment may be applied the interior face of glazing where existing interior conditions preclude the installation of clear transom windows; or at a service entrance.

   (4) Framing. Entrance framing must feature profiled trim that recalls the articulation of historic entrance framing, and the details will be traditional or contemporary, except that at small residential buildings the framing details must recall traditional framing.

   (5) Orientation. New infill must be installed parallel to the building's sidewalk and consistent with the plane of the facade, and must be set back from the face of the existing entrance surround the minimum dimension required to avoid concealing any significant architectural feature, including features previously concealed by existing entrance infill, but in no event less than four (4) inches from the face of the entrance surround.

   (6) Entrances and doors.

      (i) The new entrance will be accessible if feasible or required by law; and

      (ii) The design of the new door will maintain the design intent of new entrance infill required by this section, or will match the original or historic door pursuant to the criteria for door replacement addressed in subdivision (f) of this section.

   (7) Material. If the building was constructed prior to 1900, the material of the new infill must match the historic material, if known, or be wood; for buildings constructed in or after 1900, or built before and altered in or after 1900 to include entrances, the material of the new infill may be wood or metal or match the historic material, except that:

      (i) At small residential buildings of six (6) stories or less and with a street frontage of forty (40) feet or less, the material of the new infill must match the historic material, except that corner rowhouses, town houses, mansions, detached and semi-detached houses and carriage houses are subject to this clause regardless of the length of the facade with the longest street frontage.

      (ii) Service entrances, such as those that historically accessed freight elevators or had other utilitarian uses, may be wood or metal regardless of when the building was constructed, in keeping with similar service entrances found within the specific historic district and for buildings of similar age, type and style.

   (8) Finish. New entrance infill must have a finish that recalls the finish of historic or approved entrances or is otherwise harmonious with the building.

   (9) Removal of modern cladding. If an applicant is proposing to remove modern cladding on the entrance or the area surrounding the entrance, the applicant must first perform probes of the material to see if historic material or elements exist behind the modern cladding.

      (i) If significant historic material or elements exists underneath the cladding, the historic material must be restored and the new entrance can only be approved pursuant to 63 RCNY § 2-11(f).

      (ii) If a significant portion of the historic entrance surround exists underneath the cladding, but no historic entrance infill remains, the entrance surround must be restored, pursuant to 63 RCNY § 2-11(f), as part of the application for new entrance infill under this paragraph.

   (10) Restoration of the original entrance opening. If the original entrance opening has been reduced or increased in size the design may maintain the existing entrance opening, or may include the restoration of the height and width of the original opening, except that where interior conditions preclude restoration to the original height (e.g., later structural elements or existing interior roll gate housing or mechanical systems):

      (i) The existing entrance opening may be enlarged or reduced to the greatest extent feasible; and

      (ii) The design of the surround is consistent with or harmonious the materials and details of the historic base of the building.

   (11) Modification of the existing entrance opening. If the existing entrance opening is not original to the building, the proposed work may maintain the existing entrance opening or may include the modification of the height and width of the existing opening, and may introduce new architectural features on the area surrounding the entrance, provided that the design of the surround is consistent or harmonious with the materials and details of the historic base of the building.








*§ 2-15 Additions: Rooftop and Rear Yard Additions or Enlargements.* ::


(a) Applicability.

   (1) This section addresses LPC Staff approvals for additions to existing buildings, including rooftop, rear and side yard additions. It does not apply to additions to buildings in scenic landmarks.

   (2) This section does not apply to any building already subject to a District Master Plan that includes criteria for additions. (See 63 RCNY Chapters 4, 6 and 12, and the Sunnyside Gardens Historic District guidelines.)

      (i) Traditional and modern materials and finishes at the facade facing the central open space, such as brick, stucco or fiber cement siding, but excluding exposed or painted concrete or concrete masonry units, vinyl siding, and exterior insulated finish systems ("EIFS"). The lot-line walls must have a neutral finished surface, but cannot be exposed or painted concrete or concrete masonry units or vinyl siding;

      (ii) Window and door openings and configurations that will be consistent with the criteria established in 63 RCNY § 2-14 for new and modified windows and doors at minimally or non-visible secondary facades; and

      (iii) If the work involves combining adjacent buildings the addition expresses the original width of each of the historic buildings.

   (8) The proposed addition or enlargement will not extend to the rear lot line or substantially eliminate the presence of a rear yard; except an addition may be approved which fills in an enclosed central or side court that is not open to the rear yard, and the addition is no more than one story above the existing grade.

   (9) Decks. A rear facade of a building, or an existing addition or proposed addition may include a projecting wood or metal deck that is minimally visible, provided the deck projects from the ground or parlor floor and extends no more than eight (8) feet from the facade it projects from, excluding steps from the deck down to the rear yard, but in no instance shall the deck intrude into a required rear yard. If the deck is proposed to be projecting from a proposed addition, the existence of the deck shall not be a factor in determining the depth of the proposed addition, as determined by paragraph (6) above.

(g) Rooftop and Rear Yard Additions; Cumulative Impact of Additions. LPC Staff will consider the cumulative impact of occupiable rooftop and rear yard additions when considering an application for an addition. LPC Staff will not approve a new occupiable rooftop addition if there is an existing or approved rear yard addition, but not including an original partial width "el", or a new rear yard addition if there is an existing or approved occupiable rooftop addition. For purposes of his subdivision, a deck above the rear yard off the historic rear facade shall not count as a rear addition. Nothing in this subdivision shall prevent LPC Staff from approving the rebuilding of an existing rear yard or rooftop addition.

      (ii) Simply designed and finished to match the adjacent facade material or other neutral finish; and

      (iii) The post will be an unobtrusive presence in conjunction with the facade and will not detract from or obscure any significant architectural features of the building.

(e) Handrails and Areaway Alterations.

   (1) LPC Staff will issue an approval for a proposed handrail on an existing stoop or areaway steps on a building in a historic district or scenic landmark if the work meets all of the following relevant criteria:

      (i) The installation of the handrail will not damage any decorative features of the masonry stoop walls, ironwork, or areaway enclosure;

      (ii) The handrail will be simply designed and will not detract from the significant architectural features of the building; and

      (iii) The handrail will be attached to the coping of the stoop wall, inside the stoop wall, or at the treads, whichever location the LPC Staff determines is the least obtrusive, taking into account other such installations on the block and the purpose of the handrail.

   (2) LPC Staff will issue an approval for a proposal to alter an areaway enclosure to accommodate an accessible entrance:

      (i) If the areaway enclosure consists of historic ironwork or masonry, the alterations are as minimal as possible to meet accessibility requirements and the ironwork and/or masonry is finished to match the historic condition; and

      (ii) If no historic fabric exists in the areaway, the ironwork and/or masonry is finished to match the existing conditions.

(f) Ramps. LPC Staff may issue an approval for certain ramps as specified below. For purposes of this subdivision, a "ramp" includes the associated landing(s) and any steps integrated into the ramp.

   (1) Ramps without handrails. Ramps that do not require a handrail may be approved on individual landmarks and buildings in historic districts and scenic landmarks if:

      (i) The installation will not result in damage to significant historic fabric, including sidewalk paving materials or vault lights, steps and landings, or will involve the removal or modification of discrete portions of historic fabric, and the fabric that is removed is re-used in connection with the ramp work where possible;

      (ii) The ramp will be constructed in materials to match the immediately adjacent facade material or sidewalk and threshold paving, or with utilitarian materials with a neutral finish so as to have an unobtrusive presence on the building;

      (iii) The ramp will be as short as possible, with no switch-backs, except that LPC Staff may approve a longer ramp, with no switch-backs, if the longer ramp will have less visual impact on the facade; and

      (iv) The proposed changes will not detract from the special architectural and historic character of the building.

   (2) Ramps with handrails. Ramps that require a handrail may be approved for buildings in historic districts and scenic landmarks that are not individual landmarks if:

      (i) The installation of the ramp and handrails will not eliminate or conceal any significant architectural features of the building or sidewalk, or landscape feature if in a scenic landmark, except as provided for below;

      (ii) The installation is obscured or partially obscured by existing architectural features where possible, such as ironwork or masonry walls;

      (iii) The ramp will be as short as possible, with no switch-backs and intermediate landings, except that LPC Staff may approve a longer ramp, with no switch-backs, if they determine that the longer ramp will have less visual impact on the facade;

      (iv) For storefronts, the ramp will be confined to the storefront or building associated with the entrance being made accessible;

      (v) For buildings with deeply recessed entrance courts or areaways, a ramp must be located within the recess, unless LPC Staff determines that a different location provides equal accessibility with less impact on the building;

      (vi) The presence and location of the ramp will not disrupt, or will be consistent with, the facade's composition. For purposes of this rule, steps and landing leading to the entryway that are extending outward to receive the ramp should retain the historic orientation where feasible, and the favored position for a ramp in a recessed court or areaway is presumed to be off to one side so that it is as inconspicuous as possible, but, depending on the facade's composition, LPC Staff may determine that another location is more consistent and harmonious with the design of the facade;

      (vii) Minimal excavation will be permitted to facilitate barrier-free access;

      (viii) The handrail will be simply designed with the minimum number of vertical elements permitted;

      (ix) The ramp will be simply designed and constructed in materials to match the immediately adjacent facade material or ironwork, or with utilitarian materials with a neutral finish, whichever will result in the least obtrusive presence on the building; and

      (x) The proposed work will not detract from the special architectural and historic character of the building, district or scenic landmark.

(g) Lifts. LPC Staff may issue an approval for a wheelchair platform lift or a chair lift on a rail on a building in a historic district or scenic landmark, other than an individual landmark, if the proposed work meets all of the following relevant criteria:

   (1) Wheelchair platform lifts.

      (i) The lift will not require significant alterations to existing fabric at the proposed location, and any such alterations are reversible;

      (ii) Only minimal historic fabric will be removed to access the lift at the elevated position;

      (iii) The lift will be located in a recessed location on the facade, or otherwise located to not disrupt the facade's composition, and will be obscured or partially obscured by existing features such as ironwork or masonry walls;

      (iv) The lift will be stored in the down position to minimize its visual presence; and

      (v) The lift will be finished to match the immediately adjacent facade materials, or will have a neutral finish; and

      (vi) The proposed work will not detract from the special architectural and historic character of the building, streetscape or scenic landmark.

   (2) Wheelchair and chair lifts on rails.

      (i) The installation does not require any significant alterations to the existing areaway, stoop, handrail, or building facade, and is reversible;

      (ii) The installation will require minimal attachment points through non-decorative elements; and

      (iii) The lift will be painted to match the finish of the adjacent ironwork or masonry, or will have a neutral finish.

      (iv) The proposed work will not detract from the special architectural and historic character of the building, streetscape or scenic landmark.

(h) Replacement or Modification of Existing Commission-Approved or Grandfathered Ramps and Lifts. If an applicant can demonstrate that it is not feasible to replace or modify an existing ramp to meet the requirements of this section, LPC Staff may issue an approval to modify or replace an existing Commission-approved or grandfathered ramp or lift to meet current accessibility codes if the work meets all of the following relevant criteria:

   (1) The replacement ramp will match or be smaller and/or shorter than the existing ramp in terms of footprint and overall rise, or is altered to the minimum degree necessary for compliance;

   (2) The replacement ramp will be constructed using materials that either match the materials and handrail design of the existing ramp or match the adjacent facade material and/or railing, or utilitarian materials with a neutral finish. A change in handrail design to the minimum number of vertical elements required by code is permitted;

   (3) The platform lift and guiderails will be installed in the same locations using existing penetrations in the building facade or other elements. Some additional penetrations may be approved if required to meet code.

   (4) The lift mechanicals will be located in the same location and will match the footprint and height of the existing mechanicals, or will be reduced in size;

   (5) The lift may be fully enclosed if necessary to meet code; and

   (6) The previously approved finishes will be maintained or modified to better blend with the adjacent facade material.








*§ 2-19 Sidewalks.* ::


(a) General Requirements.

   (1) Scope. This section applies to sidewalk replacement in historic districts where the paving material is a significant feature (e.g., bluestone, granite and brick) or the location of the sidewalk is a significant feature (e.g., "ribbon sidewalks where there is a planted area between the curb and the sidewalk not limited to tree pits) and where the existing sidewalks adequately recall the historic paving, either by the amount of historic paving that remains or due to the combination of historic paving and tinted sidewalks that exists in the district, or the location of the sidewalk. For purposes of this section, the term "sidewalk" means the portion of the sidewalk and curb fronting upon specific property.

      (i) Appendix A of this section sets forth the list of historic districts that are subject to the provisions of this section. These historic districts are districts where historic paving was a significant feature and where there currently exists sufficient historic or tinted paving to adequately recall this historic condition. For these districts the long-term regulatory goal is to replace non-historic paving with paving that matches the historic paving material in terms of standard characteristics or which adequately recalls the historic paving material through a tinted concrete.

      (ii) For historic districts designated after the effective date of these rules, the designation report must explicitly state whether the sidewalk paving is a significant feature and will be subject to these rules. The Commission will maintain a list on its website and at its offices of all historic districts subject to this rule.

      (iii) In all other historic districts no approval is required from the Commission for replacing sidewalks.

   (2) Other approvals. In addition to the requirements set forth in this section, all methods and materials for sidewalk work must conform to all applicable rules, requirements and guidelines of the Department of Transportation ("DOT") and the Department of Design and Construction.

(b) Repairing, Resetting and New Bluestone Sidewalks. LPC Staff will issue an approval to repair and/or reset existing bluestone pavers, or to install new bluestone pavers, if the work satisfies all of the following relevant criteria:

   (1) Resetting and repairing existing bluestone pavers. If intact pavers exist, they must be preserved if they meet applicable DOT standards for thickness and size, and must be reset pursuant to DOT standards. Small amounts of cementitious patching, tinted to match the color of the pavers, can be applied to preserve existing pavers that have spalled, and the joint between pavers may be ground down to produce a level surface.

   (2) New bluestone pavers. If the existing sidewalk is missing one or more bluestone pavers, or the existing bluestone pavers are beyond reasonable repair due to cracking or other conditions, or the owner is proposing to install a new bluestone sidewalk where no bluestone exists, new bluestone pavers may be installed, consistent with the DOT specifications and installation requirements, if:

      (i) The pavers will closely match the existing bluestone pavers, if any, with respect to dimension, color and paver pattern; and

      (ii) The edges of the pavers can be sawn, rubbed or thermal.

   (3) Consolidation of existing bluestone pavers. If the existing sidewalk is missing bluestone pavers, or some of the existing bluestone pavers are beyond the point of reasonable repair due to cracking or other conditions, the existing bluestone pavers that meet DOT standards for thickness and size may be consolidated and tinted concrete pavers installed in the remaining area, provided:

      (i) The maximum number of intact bluestone pavers will be consolidated within the sidewalk;

      (ii) Resetting of bluestone pavers will meet the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision;

      (iii) New concrete pavers are tinted and scored to match the historic bluestone pavers;

      (iv) An existing bluestone or granite curb will be retained if possible, and any replacement curb will be granite or tinted/untinted concrete to match adjacent curbing; and

      (v) For purposes of this paragraph (3), if the enlargement of a sidewalk tree pit requires the removal of some or all of a bluestone paver:

         (A) The removal of bluestone will be the minimum necessary to meet the applicable requirements, and

         (B) The bluestone paver, or the part that is removed, will be consolidated within the property lines if there are areas of the sidewalk that do not have bluestone pavers, provided the paver, or part thereof, otherwise meets applicable DOT standards.

(c) Replacement of an Existing Non-Bluestone Sidewalk. Where the property on which the sidewalk exists is not part of a bluestone sidewalk, and the owner does not intend to install a new bluestone sidewalk consistent with the requirements of subdivision (b), the new sidewalk must:

   (1) Consist of concrete pavers scored to match the size of pavers on adjacent sidewalks, with saw-cut joints. If the sidewalk is adjacent to a bluestone or bluestone-tinted concrete sidewalk the new sidewalk must be tinted to match the bluestone. If the sidewalk is not adjacent to a bluestone or bluestone-tinted concrete sidewalk the sidewalk may be either untinted concrete to match the adjacent sidewalk or bluestone-tinted concrete; and

   (2) An existing bluestone or granite curb will be retained if possible, and any replacement curb will be bluestone, granite or tinted/untinted concrete to match adjacent curbing. DOT???*

* Editor's note: So in original.

   (3) Unique or decorative scoring patterns may be used at front entryways of large apartment buildings, hotel or commercial buildings in historic districts if there is evidence that the building once had such decorative paving or if decorative scoring is a characteristic of the building type (e.g., hotel, large apartment building or club building) and the design does not call undue attention to itself or detract from the significant architectural features of the building or streetscape.

   (4) Metal post plates, and/or bolt holes associated with detachable flood protection barriers, may be installed in concrete sidewalks, provided the post plates are set flush with the sidewalk and the installation does not call undue attention to itself or detract from the building or streetscape.

(d) Vault Lights. LPC Staff will issue an approval to repair or replace existing vault lights, re-create missing vault lights, or recall the presence of missing historic vault lights with diamond plate if the proposed work satisfies all of the following relevant criteria:

   (1) New vault lights.

      (i) New vault lights may be approved to restore missing vault lights, or to replace existing vault lights, whether uncovered or covered by diamond plate steel or concrete, that are beyond reasonable repair;

      (ii) New vault lights will match the existing or historic vault lights in terms of approximate panel size and overall footprint, material, finish and details;

      (iii) Where no vault lights exist, the basis for the design and materials of the new vault lights will be based on photographic or physical evidence relating to the building or adjacent buildings, or, if no documentation exists, the design and materials will be based on vault lights found at buildings of similar age, style and type;

      (iv) New vault lights may be set flush with the existing sidewalk over the original or new metal framing or over a solid concrete substrate where the historic condition occurred at grade, or set on the original or new metal platform where the historic condition was raised above grade.

   (2) Protection of existing uncovered and deteriorated vault lights. Existing uncovered vault lights that are in a deteriorated state and are no longer water-tight may be protected by covering the vault lights with dark-finished diamond plate steel. Vault lights at vertical surfaces and lower-traffic areas such as steps and landings should remain uncovered where feasible.

   (3) Protection of existing covered vault lights.

      (i) Existing vault lights that are covered by diamond plate steel or concrete may be re-covered with new dark-finished diamond plate steel;

      (ii) If the existing vault lights underneath the diamond plate or concrete are highly deteriorated or broken, they may be removed and replaced with new vault lights in accordance with paragraph (1).

   (4) Replacing diamond plate. If no vault lights are present under existing diamond plate steel, the diamond plate steel will be replaced with new dark finished diamond plate steel, except that if the historic district in which the building exists is not characterized by vault lights and/or diamond plate, the staff may approve replacing the diamond plate with concrete to match the adjacent concrete.

(e) Granite Sidewalks. LPC Staff will issue an approval to repair or reset existing granite sidewalks, or to install new granite sidewalks, and new concrete pavers tinted to match the existing granite pavers, if the work satisfies all of the following relevant criteria:

   (1) The maximum number of intact granite pavers will be maintained or consolidated within the property lines;

   (2) Areas no longer covered by granite pavers will be replaced with new granite pavers or concrete pavers tinted and scored to recall the size of the historic granite pavers and saw cut;

   (3) Existing granite pavers will be sliced horizontally to create new or lighter pavers, provided that (i) the footprint of each paver is maintained and the paver is reinstalled in approximately the same location, and (ii) the resulting paver(s) will maintain a minimum of three to four (3 - 4) inch thickness and otherwise meet DOT requirements and comply with Department of Buildings structural requirements; and

   (4) New granite pavers will match the color, texture, dimensions and edge treatment of the existing granite pavers and will have a slip-resistant finish in accordance with DOT requirements.

(f) Other Sidewalk Materials. LPC Staff may issue an approval to repair, reset or replace in-kind sidewalks of different historic materials, such as Belgian Block, brick or special concrete aggregates, provided such material is typically found in the district. For ribbon sidewalks, defined as sidewalks located with a grass or planting strip between the sidewalk and the curb, the material should match the historic material or the predominant material in the district, and the width of the sidewalk is not increased. For unique or atypical sidewalk treatments, such as a brick sidewalk in front of a carriage house in a district characterized by bluestone sidewalks, or a special sidewalk approved by the Public Design Commission or its predecessor, LPC Staff may require repair or in-kind replacement if the sidewalk treatment represents a significant historic alteration or if removal is deemed to result in the loss of a significant historic feature.

(g) Accessible Sidewalks.

   (1) Pedestrian ramps at sidewalk intersections. LPC Staff will issue an approval to install accessible pedestrian ramps at sidewalk intersections if the proposed work satisfies all of the following relevant criteria:

      (i) For new or existing concrete sidewalks, accessible pedestrian ramps will consist of tinted concrete to match the color, texture and scoring of the adjacent or predominant sidewalk paving;

      (ii) For existing bluestone and granite sidewalks, bluestone or granite pavers may be cut, honed or otherwise modified to form the slope and flared sides of the ramp, or replaced in kind to accommodate the ramp. In addition:

         (A) If the existing sidewalk is predominately bluestone or granite, but the portion of the sidewalk at the intersection that needs to be modified is concrete, the ramp may consist of concrete tinted to match the adjacent historic paving material;

         (B) Existing bluestone or granite at the corner may be cut and moved within the property lines to replace missing or deteriorated bluestone pavers, and a concrete ramp, tinted to match the adjacent historic paving material, installed at the corner; or

         (C) Existing bluestone or granite sidewalks will remain and a concrete "neckdown" (an expansion of the sidewalk at the intersection into the road to shorten the pedestrian crosswalk) tinted to match the adjacent paving installed to accommodate the ramp and preserve the historic paving material in place;

      (iii) Detectable warning units, designed to alert people who are vision impaired that they are at an intersection, may be surface applied or imbedded into the concrete or stone; and

      (iv) The dimensions and slope of the ramp, and color differentiation for detectable warning units comply with applicable federal, state and city codes and requirements.

   (2) Sloping sidewalks. LPC Staff will issue an approval to slope a sidewalk in order to make a store or space accessible if the work will not damage or detract from historic paving or, if the sidewalk is concrete, the color and scoring pattern of the concrete matches the existing sidewalk, and the work complies with all applicable federal, state and City codes and requirements, including the requirements of 63 RCNY § 2-18, and provided that the work will not result in damage to or concealment of significant architectural features of the building.






*§ 2-20 Health, Safety and Utility Equipment.* ::


(a) Introduction. Buildings may be required to have a variety of equipment related to particular health, safety and utility maintenance. These types of installations can be mandated by the Fire and Building Codes (e.g., fire alarm bells and Siamese connections) or by utilities (e.g., gas and electricity meters). Other equipment is not required by law but is commonly used for safety reasons (e.g., window security bars, security cameras, lighting and intercom panels). Given the relatively small and/or discrete nature of these types of installations, their physical requirements and constraints, and their ubiquitous presence throughout the city, these types of equipment can be installed without having a significant effect on architectural features or detracting from such features or the building or, in the case of buildings in historic districts, from adjacent buildings or the streetscape.

(b) General Installation Criteria. LPC Staff may issue an approval for work on individual landmarks, buildings in historic districts and scenic landmarks to install health, safety and utility equipment, such as the examples listed below in subdivision (c), if the proposed work meets all of the following relevant criteria:

   (1) The installation will not occur on or in front of a primary facade unless there is no feasible alternative for the installation or the location is mandated by another law or rule. In making a determination that there is no feasible alternative, LPC Staff will consider whether the need for such equipment on the primary facade is necessitated by recent or related discretionary interior renovations;

   (2) The equipment will be attached in a manner that minimizes damage to, or loss of, any significant architectural features and will be installed at mortar joints or through plain brick, stone or wood to the greatest extent possible;

   (3) If the installation is proposed to be made through areaway or sidewalk paving, the installation will not be installed through historic paving unless there is no feasible alternative;

   (4) If the installation is required by applicable law or rule it will be as small as feasible;

   (5) The finish of the equipment if not otherwise required by law or rule, will match the surrounding building material or will not call undue attention to its presence;

   (6) If the installation requires a conduit: there will be no visible conduit or, if this is not feasible, a maximum of approximately ten (10) inches of visible conduit will be permitted; the conduit will not be placed on decorative surfaces; the visible conduit will be painted to match the background surface and will be secured into mortar joints where possible; and, if there are multiple proposed or existing installations, the proposed installation of conduit will, to the maximum extent feasible, combine and minimize the amount of conduit;

   (7) The installation will be either not visible from a public thoroughfare or as minimally visible as possible (e.g., beneath a band course, underneath a stoop, behind an areaway wall or fence, or behind plantings). Unless the installation meets the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the installation will be on a secondary facade; and

   (8) The proposed installation will not call undue attention to itself or detract from any significant architectural feature(s) of the building or of adjacent buildings if the work is occurring in a historic district, by virtue of its size or proximity to any such features or buildings.

(c) Certain Types of Equipment and Additional Criteria. The following are the types of installations addressed by this section, including, where appropriate, installation criteria that are in addition to the general criteria set forth in subdivision (b) of this section:

   (1) Utility meters, including electrical, gas and water meters.

   (2) Fire alarm bells.

   (3) Light fixtures and intercom panels. These installations must be installed within the door opening or adjacent to the door opening, and will be limited to a maximum of two light fixtures and one intercom panel per door opening, except that an intercom panel may also be installed on a fence or wall in front of the entranceway.

   (4) Security cameras. These installations must be as small and as limited in number as feasible, with no more than two (2) security cameras for every twenty-five (25) feet of street frontage for small residential or commercial buildings of six (6) stories or less and with a street frontage of forty (40) feet or less, and no more than three (3) security cameras for every twenty-five (25) feet of street frontage for larger commercial, residential and institutional buildings. In every case the security camera(s) will be located to avoid a cluttered or haphazard appearance, and must be attached in a manner and location that minimizes their visible impact.

   (5) Hookups for temporary generators and boilers, electrical boxes, inverter boxes.

   (6) Mailboxes and mail key lockboxes. These installations must be installed within or adjacent to the door opening. If a building has a stoop, the mailbox may be attached to a gate or door underneath the stoop or, provided the installation meets the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (8) of this subdivision, to the facade of the building or stoop adjacent to the doorway underneath the stoop. A mailbox may also be attached to an areaway fence, or may be free-standing in the areaway if the attachment does not damage original or historic fabric or call undue attention to itself or detract from significant features of the building or adjacent building.

   (7) Exterior Siamese connections/standpipes, oil fill pipes, boiler and dryer vents, water spigots.

   (8) Rooftop security fences installed between properties. These installations may be installed only on small commercial buildings or large commercial or residential buildings, provided that they:

      (i) Will not cause damage to any significant architectural feature of any facade or the roof;

      (ii) Will be as low as is practicable and allowed by the Fire Code or the Building Code;

      (iii) Will not be installed in front of or below a cornice where there is a continuous cornice line; and

      (iv) Will either not be visible or will be minimally visible, or the visibility will be in the context of other rooftop features and will not call undue attention to itself or detract from the significant architectural features of the building or adjacent buildings.

   (9) Certain heating, venting or air-conditioning equipment ("HVAC"). HVAC (including air intakes or exhausts at basement, cellar or areaway windows, walls or floors) that, due to existing structural or other physical constraints, must be installed below the second story at or in front of the primary facade or visible secondary facade. Staff may decide not to approve such installation if staff determines that the structural or other condition necessitating such installation was the result of recent or related discretionary interior changes.

   (10) Window security bars installed at cellar, basement or parlor floor windows. These installations may be installed on any building, provided they:

      (i) Will not cause damage to any significant architectural feature of any facade;

      (ii) Will match historic ironwork or be of a simple design and will not call undue attention to themselves or detract from the significant architectural features of the building;

      (iii) Will fasten to the window frame or surround at limited attachment points, and will not include continuous perimeter framing.

   (11) Security gates at door openings below or under stoops. These installations can be installed on any building, provided that they:

      (i) Will not cause damage to, or detract from, any significant architectural feature of any facade;

      (ii) Will match historic ironwork or be of a simple design and will not call undue attention to itself or detract from the significant architectural features of the building;

      (iii) Will fasten to the door surround at limited attachment points, and will not include continuous perimeter framing.

      (iv) If replacing a grandfathered door where no door existed originally or historically, a new door may be approved if it maximizes the amount of transparency, with or without new ironwork, in keeping with the appearance of open gates below stoops.

   (12) Detachable flood protection barriers. Penetrations through plain areas of the facade (excluding decorative masonry or metalwork, and cast iron) at discrete locations for mechanical fastening of flood barriers, with plugs finished to match the surrounding material, and permanent posts at service and garage door openings and loading bays, with associated hardware finished to match the surrounding material or otherwise neutral in finish, may be installed, provided the installation does not call undue attention to itself or detract from the building or streetscape.








*§ 2-21 Installation of Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and other Mechanical Equipment.* ::


(a) Introduction. These rules set forth criteria for LPC Staff approval of heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("HVAC") or other mechanical equipment in buildings which are designated landmarks or are within designated historic districts or scenic landmarks. These rules are based on the following principles:

   (1) The distinguishing historical qualities or character of a building or its site should be protected. The removal or alteration of any significant architectural feature should be avoided.

   (2) The visual integrity of the building's exterior walls should be maintained.

   (3) In general, HVAC and other mechanical equipment are part of a building's infrastructure that must be installed in compliance with various building and energy codes, and health and safety standards. These codes and standards change over time due to technological advances, and as a result of the changing needs of occupants.

   (4) HVAC and other mechanical equipment play a critical role in the sustainability and resiliency of historic buildings. Applicants are encouraged to install appropriate HVAC and mechanical equipment that meet or exceed the requirements of the New York City Energy Conservation Code, even if the equipment is exempt from such standards.

   (5) Applicants are strongly encouraged to develop building master plans for the installation of HVAC equipment, which will facilitate expeditious review and approval of applications.

(b) Definitions.

   Decorative masonry. The term "decorative masonry" means terra cotta, cast-stone or natural stone (such as limestone, marble, brownstone or granite) and brick facade areas and/or any ornamental feature which is a component of the facade such as belt courses, banding, water tables, cornices, corbelled brick work, medallions, enframements, and surrounds, and ornamental bonding patterns, e.g., tapestry or diaper brick patterns. The term does not include entirely plain units of stone, masonry or brick laid up with simple, non-decorative coursing.

   HVAC equipment. The term "HVAC equipment" includes through-window, through-wall, rooftop, areaway, and facade and yard mounted heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment, including louvers, wall-mounted louvers and stove, restaurant, bathroom and/or dryer vents.

   Mechanical equipment. The term "mechanical equipment" means equipment other than HVAC equipment, such as solar and wind power equipment, batteries and emergency generators, and including any associated elements such as safety railings and sound attenuation screens, baffles and other structures.

   Minimally visible. The term "minimally visible" means visibility of any portion of the HVAC or other mechanical equipment which, from its maximum point of visibility, when viewed from any public thoroughfare:

      (1) Projects into the maximum line of sight from such public thoroughfare no more than twelve (12) inches in height if the equipment is less than sixty (60) feet above the ground, projects no more than eighteen (18) inches if the equipment is between sixty-one (61) and eighty (80) feet above the ground, and projects no more than twenty-four (24) inches if the equipment is between eighty-one (81) and one hundred (100) feet above the ground, and projects no more than thirty-six (36) inches if the equipment is more than one hundred (100) feet above the ground; or

      (2) Does not call attention to itself or detract from any significant architectural features of the building or other buildings if in a historic district. In determining whether equipment does not call attention to itself or detract the LPC Staff will consider the following factors:

         (i) The visibility meets the requirements of paragraph (1) above;

         (ii) The equipment is visible at a significant distance;

         (iii) The equipment is visible from very limited vantage points, including through alleyways, yards, or similar open portions of sites which are not building sites;

         (iv) The equipment is visible from an oblique angle; or

         (v) The equipment is visible in combination with other existing additions or structures that share a similar level of visibility.

   Primary facade. The term "primary facade" means:

      (1) A facade fronting a street or public thoroughfare that is not a street, such as a mews or court;

      (2) A visible facade that possesses a level of design or significant architectural features that are commensurate with the building's street-fronting facade(s), and where such facade (i) faces but does not front a street, such as a setback facade, or (ii) is part of a dominant massing element where at least one facade is street-fronting or street-facing, such as a tower element; and

      (3) A facade with a primary entrance to the building.

   Secondary facade. The term "secondary facade" means a facade that does not front on a street or a public thoroughfare and that does not possess significant architectural features that are commensurate with the street fronting facade.

Terms not otherwise defined in these rules have the meanings ascribed to them in the Landmarks Law.

(c) Installations of HVAC Equipment Within Window Openings.

   (1) No permit required. No permit is required for installing seasonal and non-permanent HVAC equipment in windows if the following relevant criteria are satisfied:

      (i) Seasonal window air-conditioning unit installations.

         (A) The installation requires only raising or lowering the sash of a double-hung window, or opening the sash of a casement, hopper or awning window or transom, and temporarily fixing the sash in place without removing it;

         (B) The window unit and any filler panel (glazed or solid) will be installed at any location within the window frame, and will not fully rest on an architectural element of the facade outside of the window frame, such as a cornice, parapet or sill; and

         (C) The support brackets, if required, will fasten to the window frame or the interior side of the wall opening, and/or may brace against the exterior wall without mechanical attachments.

Chapter 6: Proposed Alterations and New Construction of Structures and Landscapes In the Riverdale Historic District
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 6-01 Introduction.* ::


The purpose of these rules is to establish the Landmarks Preservation Commission's regulatory policy in the Riverdale Historic District. The Riverdale Historic District which was developed as an early railroad suburb is characterized as a distinct area of the city by its dramatic and verdant topography and its fine examples of nineteenth and early twentieth century dwellings and carriage houses. The houses and other buildings in the district are harmoniously sited within the landscape and are separated from each other by landscape Improvements. Landscaping in the Riverdale Historic District provides the picturesque setting which is a defining element of a romantic style suburb of the nineteenth century. Landscape Improvements such as trees, stone walls and hedges, used to define property lines, and additional plantings within the expansive gardens and alongside the houses, add to the special character of the Historic District. The district contains 34 buildings of varied type and age. The development of the Riverdale Historic District is important in understanding the district's historic character. Originally, the area was comprised of only seven estates which were served by a common carriage alley (Sycamore Avenue). All of the estates were developed in the 1850s. Several early estate houses remain, as well as stables and carriage houses (later converted for residential use). The configuration of these estates remained intact until 1935, when the original parcels began to be subdivided for development. Four new houses were built between 1935 and 1938. No new buildings were built thereafter until 1950. From 1950 to 1980 twelve new structures were constructed. These newer structures are stylistically diverse but are generally compatible with the older buildings in terms of their placement, height, materials and finish.

(c) Conditions for Chair's Discretionary Renewal.

   (1) Extraordinary circumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Chair of the Commission has the discretion, based on extraordinary circumstances, to allow the renewal of any LPC Staff or Commission approval. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to:

      (i) Delays resulting from the inability to obtain other governmental approvals, licenses or permits, but not including time spent in connection with applying for an approval from the City Planning Commission that is subject to the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure ("ULURP") or from the Board of Standards and Appeals, or

      (ii) An inability, due to factors beyond the control of the applicant, to complete construction of a project within the term of such permit, where work has begun and is continuing with due diligence.

      (iii) In making a finding with respect to this subdivision, the Chair may consider whether the applicant has already obtained an LPC Staff renewal pursuant to 63 RCNY § 7-03(b)(2) and, if there was an LPC Staff renewal, whether there has been a significant change in Commission policy or practice since the LPC Staff renewal was granted.

   (2) Timing. A request for an extension under this subdivision (c) must be made in writing prior to the expiration date of the approval or within ten (10) days after receipt of notice that the approval will not be renewed pursuant to subparagraph (a) above.

      (ii) The work is continuing with due diligence;

      (iii) The applicant has all necessary permits to finish the work;

      (iv) There is no Summons or previously issued Notice of Violation in effect against the property or that part of the property subject to the permit;

      (v) The work will be substantially complete within thirty-six (36) months of the expiration date of the permit; and

   (2) Timing. A request to reinstate an expired permit under subdivision (e)(1) must be made in writing no more than ninety (90) days from the expiration of the permit, and must include supporting documentation, including the status of the work, documentation that the work that has already occurred is in compliance with the permit, and the reasons it would be unreasonable if the work had to stop. If the Chair determines that reinstatement is appropriate, the Chair will reinstate the expired permit for a stated period of time not to exceed three years after expiration of the permit and may impose reasonable conditions.

(f) No Renewal or Reinstatement if a Summons or Previously Issued Notice of Violation is in Effect Against Property. Any person who has been notified by the Commission that a permit will not be renewed or reinstated because a Summons or previously issued Notice of Violation from the Commission is in effect against the property may request that the Chair of the Commission, or the Chair's designee, review whether the notice of violation is properly in effect against the property. Such request must be made in writing within ten (10) days from the date of the notification that the permit will not be renewed and may include supporting documentation. The Chair of the Commission will respond to such request within twenty (20) days of receipt of the request. If the Chair or the Chair's designee determines that a Summons or previously issued Notice of Violation was not properly in effect against the property, the Chair will issue a renewed permit or reinstate an expired permit if it finds that all other conditions set forth in these rules have been met.








*§ 7-04 Effect of Expiration of Permits.* ::


(a) Upon expiration of any permit, such permit will terminate and be of no further effect, except if the permit is renewed or reinstated pursuant to 63 RCNY § 7-03 or otherwise complies with the provisions of 63 RCNY § 7-02(a)(3). Work done after an approval has expired, except for reasonable and necessary work undertaken to stabilize and secure the site pending application for and issuance of a renewed or reinstated approval subject to 63 RCNY § 7-03, or a new approval, will constitute a violation of the Landmarks Law and may be subject to enforcement proceedings. A renewed or reinstated permit will not be a defense against any enforcement proceedings related to work occurring after the expiration and before such renewal or reinstatement.

(b) An applicant may apply for a new permit for work which is the subject of an expired permit. The Commission will treat such application as a new application in all respects and it will be subject to all applicable procedures, rules and guidelines in effect at the time of such application.








*§ 7-05 Revocation of Approvals.* ::


(a) The Commission may revoke the approval of any certificate of no effect, certificate of appropriateness, permit for minor work, binding or advisory report, notice to proceed, or any amendments thereof, whenever:

      (i) there is a failure to comply with the provisions of chapter 3 of title 25 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, or this title of the Rules of the City of New York;

      (ii) there is any incorrect or false statement or any misrepresentation or omission in the documents submitted in the application for approval with respect to a fact that was material to the issuance of the approval;

      (iii) or an approval has been issued in error and conditions are such that approval should not have been issued. In such an event, the Commission will issue a "Notice of Intent to Revoke" ("Notice") that will inform the applicant of the reasons for the proposed revocation. The applicant has the right to present to the commissioner or his or her representative information on why the approval should not be revoked. The applicant must present such evidence within 10 business days if the Notice was personally served or 15 calendar days if the Notice was sent by mail.

(b) Effect on Approval. Upon issuance of a Notice all work must cease immediately and no work will occur at the site until such time as the Commission shall withdraw the Notice and reinstate the approval. Revocation of an approval will be effective upon the issuance of a written Final Decision of Revocation by the commissioner after the time period for submission of rebuttal information has ended. The Final Decision of Revocation should be issued within 20 working days after the time period for the applicant to respond has expired, or within ten working days after receipt of a written request for issuance of a Final Decision of Revocation if the commissioner fails to issue the Final Decision of Revocation in the initial 20 working day period. The Final Decision of Revocation will state the reasons that the approval is being withdrawn. The revocation of any approval is the automatic revocation of all associated approvals (including certificates, permits, reports, notices or amendments in the future) that may have been issued.

(c) The Notice of Intent to Revoke and the Final Decision of Revocation may be issued by personal service or sent by registered mail to the applicant's address as it appears in the application. If the registered mail is unsuccessful, the commission may send the notice using the procedures permitted in § 25-313 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York.

(d) Enforcement action. All or some of the work performed in connection with an approval that has been revoked may be subject to enforcement action under §§ 25-317, 25-317.1 and 25-317.2 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York. Such enforcement action may start upon the issuance of a written final decision by the commissioner or his or her designee to revoke the approval.

Chapter 9: Alterations To Designated Bank Interiors
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 9-01 Introduction.* ::


(a)  These rules are issued to assist building owners in applying to the Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) for approval of applications to undertake repair, rehabilitation, replacement of, or alterations to interior architectural features within designated bank interiors. The rules set forth Commission policy with respect to such repair, rehabilitation, replacement, or alteration and explain the procedures required to apply for a permit. The goal of these rules is to facilitate and encourage the continued historic use of these interiors as banking floors and to facilitate the adaptive reuse of the interior if it ceases to be used as a banking floor.

(b) These rules are based on the following principles:

   (1) The significant original visual qualities or character of a designated interior should not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any significant architectural feature should be avoided whenever possible.

   (2) Significant but deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible.

   (3) Certain interior alterations can be approved at staff level in conformance with the procedures set forth in these rules. Other interior alterations require review by the full Commission in accordance with its usual review procedures.

(c) These rules are keyed to underlined portions of the Description section of the Designation Reports for these interior landmarks, which identify significant architectural features requiring protection.

(d) Applicants are encouraged to submit applications for Master Plans which will govern the approval of routine and continuing alterations such as installation of mechanical and electrical equipment.






*§ 9-02 Definitions.* ::

These features comprise all of the interior architectural features of the interior with the exception of those features that are underscored in the designation report.

Significant features. The term "significant features" shall mean the interior architectural features of the designated interior that the LPC has determined contribute to the special historic, cultural, and/or aesthetic character for which the interior was designated, and therefore require protection under these rules.

*§ 11-05 Summons; Grace Period.* ::


(a) A respondent will qualify for the grace period set forth in § 25-317.1(b)(6) of the Administrative Code, and not be subject to a fine, by delivering, at least fourteen (14) days prior to the hearing date set forth in the Summons or previously issued Notice of Violation, the following to the Commission:

   (1) Admission of liability, and

   (2) proof, satisfactory to the Commission, that the violation has been corrected, or

   (3) an application to legalize or cure the violation.

(b) For purposes of paragraph (2), "proof" means the submission of an affidavit or other sworn statement describing the violation and the work performed to correct the violation. The affidavit or sworn statement must be supplemented by photographs and any other supporting material that demonstrates that the illegal condition has been corrected. The Commission may reject the proof submitted if it does not unequivocally demonstrate that the illegal condition has been corrected.

Chapter 12: Historic District Master Plans
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 12-01 District Master Plans and Authorizations to Proceed.* ::


(a)  Introduction. The Commission may develop master plans for the historic district, specific types of buildings within a historic district, distinctive areas within the historic district or for landmark sites containing multiple buildings. A district master plan may address common design issues such as storefront design, signage, sidewalk and areaway alterations as well as set forth specific alterations for individual buildings in an historic district or on a landmark site in a comprehensive manner that respects the significant architectural features and particular history of the historic district with allowances for specific building conditions. A district master plan may serve as a research tool or design guide for owners or tenants who wish to make alterations to their buildings. Upon the adoption of implementation rules as set forth in this rule, Commission staff can also issue authorizations to proceed for certain types of alterations or work set forth in the district master plan. A District Master Plan does not preclude the Commission's consideration and approval of applications for proposed work that is not in compliance with the District Master Plan.

(b) District Master Plans. Upon its own motion, the Commission may consider a master plan for alterations in a specific historic district, an individual landmark site containing multiple buildings or with respect to certain types of buildings or types of work in a specific historic district ("District Master Plan"). A District Master Plan may be approved by a Certificate of Appropriateness, a Certificate of No Effect on Protected Architectural Features, or a Permit for Minor Work, depending on the work covered by the plan.

(c) Calendaring. A District Master Plan will not be scheduled for the Commission's consideration unless the Commission, in its discretion and upon the adoption of a motion, votes to calendar the District Master Plan for a public hearing. A motion to calendar a proposed District Master Plan for further consideration must be approved by the majority of Commissioners present in order to be adopted. The date of the public hearing on the proposed District Master Plan may be set by the motion to calendar or may be set at some later time by the Chairman, acting at his or her discretion.

(d) Public Hearing. If the Commission votes to calendar a District Master Plan for further consideration, a public hearing will be held in accordance with § 25-308 of the Administrative Code of New York City and the provisions of Chapter One of these Rules.

(e) Approval and Implementation. Following the public hearing, the Commission may vote to approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the District Master Plan. If the District Master Plan is approved or approved with modifications, the District Master Plan may be implemented by the enactment of Rules in accordance with the City Administrative Procedure Act that specifically reference the District Master Plan ("Implementation Rules"). The Implementation Rules shall establish the scope and applicability of the District Master Plan and shall set forth the application procedures and the criteria for issuance of Authorizations to Proceed ("ATP's", see 63 RCNY § 12-01(f) below) pursuant to the District Master Plan. Any work permitted under the Implementation Rules pursuant to an ATP must be described with reasonable specificity as to design and materials in the District Master Plan. The public hearing for the proposed District Master Plan may be held concurrently with the public hearing for the Implementation Rules. However, the Commission must vote to approve the District Master Plan before it votes to approve the Implementation Rules and the District Master Plan shall have no force and effect until the Implementation Rules are adopted in accordance with the City Administrative Procedure Act.

(f) Authorizations to Proceed. All applications for work pursuant to the District Master Plan must be signed by the building owner in accordance with 63 RCNY § 2-01 and must state that the application is being filed pursuant to the District Master Plan. Each application shall include drawings, specifications and other materials which describe the proposed work in detail. Commission staff will review the application to ascertain whether the proposed work is in accordance with the District Master Plan and the Implementation Rules. If Commission staff determines that the work is in compliance with the District Master Plan and the Implementation Rules, the staff will send the applicant an "Authorization to Proceed" letter ("ATP") allowing the work to commence. The ATP must be obtained prior to the commencement of work and posted on the building while work is in progress. Each ATP shall be valid for four (4) years from the date of such ATP and may be renewed upon application provided that Commission staff determines that the work authorized under the original ATP remains in compliance with the District Master Plan and the Implementation Rules in effect on the date of such renewal. Issuance or renewal of a District Master Plan ATP is contingent upon the work's adherence to the District Master Plan and the materials and plans submitted and approved by Commission staff in connection with the ATP.

(g) Amendment and Rescission. Upon its own motion, the Commission may amend or rescind a District Master Plan at any time, provided the Commission first holds a public hearing on the proposed amendment or rescission. In its discretion, the Commission shall calendar a public hearing with respect to such proposed amendment or rescission in accordance with the provisions of 63 RCNY § 12-01(b). Any Commission action to amend or rescind a District Master Plan shall be in accordance with the provisions of 63 RCNY § 1-04.
