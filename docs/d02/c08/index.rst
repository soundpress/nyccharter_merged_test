**Subchapter E: Conduct of Licensee**



*§ 5-01 Sign or Decal Required; Display of License.*


(a) Every licensee must provide to every recipient of its services a sign or decal which the licensee must obtain from the Commission. A licensee must not provide such a sign or decal to a business unless such licensee has entered into an agreement with such business to provide waste removal services. Such sign or decal must conspicuously and legibly display the name, address, telephone number, number of license and the day and approximate time of waste collection. Such sign or decal must also identify, by type, each designated recyclable material (as defined in 16 RCNY § 1-01) that will be collected by a licensee and, if applicable, whether a licensee will be using single stream recycling collection (as defined in 16 RCNY § 1-01) or co-collection of recyclables (as defined in 16 RCNY § 1-01). Any licensee that provides organic waste removal services to a designated covered establishment must also provide the designated covered establishment with a sign or decal that states (i) the name, address, telephone number, number of license and the day and approximate time of organic waste collection from the designated covered establishment; or (ii) the name, address, telephone number, number of license and the day and approximate time of organic waste collection and a statement that the licensee transports its organic waste to an entity that provides for beneficial organic waste reuse; or (iii) the name, address, telephone number, number of license and the day and approximate time of organic waste collection and a statement that the licensee provides for on-site processing of organic waste generated at its premises.

(b) Such sign(s) or decal(s) must be conspicuously posted as prescribed in Section 16-116(b) of the Code by the owner, lessee or person in control of the commercial establishment which receives the licensee's services. The licensee must provide each sign or decal to the customer and must inform the customer of its obligation to post the sign or decal in accordance with the requirements of Section 16-116(b) of the Code.

(c) A licensee must not charge a fee to any business for a sign or decal issued by the Commission.

(d) A licensee must conspicuously display its license in its place of business.








*§ 5-02 Rates.*


(a)  A trade waste removal business must not demand, charge, exact, or accept rates for the collection, removal, disposal, or recycling of trade waste greater than the following maximum rates:

   (1) $20.76 per cubic yard.

   (2) $13.62 per 100 pounds.

   (3) Exempt Waste. This subdivision does not apply to the removal of construction and demolition debris, infectious medical waste, covered electronic equipment as defined in § 421 of chapter 16 of the Code, waste from grease interceptors as defined in 15 RCNY § 19-11(a) and paper that is collected for the purpose of shredding or destruction by the licensee.

(b) The rates set forth in subdivision a of this section are maximum rates. Nothing in such subdivision shall be construed to prevent customers and trade waste removal businesses from negotiating rates lower than the rates set forth therein, and trade waste removal businesses and customers are encouraged to do so.

(c) (1) Surveys. In the event that a written contract or other agreement between a licensee and a customer contemplates a "flat" billing method, whether based on weight or on volume, a customer shall have the right to have such fee determined by a survey provided at no charge by the licensee. The time period over which the survey is to be conducted shall be determined by mutual agreement between the customer and the licensee. The survey must reflect the average amount of waste collected, either in volume or by weight, over the survey period. The cost charged to the customer for waste removal service shall be established by multiplying the negotiated dollar rate per cubic yard or per 100 pounds of waste by the total number of cubic yards or 100-pound increments, generated in the billing the period. For purpose of a "flat" billing method, a licensee may round up the total volume or weight for the billing period to the next highest cubic yard or 100 pounds. Prior to conducting the survey, the licensee shall inform the customer in writing that the survey is to be conducted and of the customer's right to participate in the survey by independently monitoring the waste collected during the survey period and by attempting to reach an agreement with the licensee on the survey information. A copy of the waste survey, in a form prescribed by the commission, must be signed by the owner of the business to be served or the owner's authorized representative and the licensee. The licensee must provide a copy of the waste survey to the customer and a copy must be retained by the licensee as part of the records required pursuant to 17 RCNY § 5-03. In the event the customer utilizes the services of a trade waste broker, the trade waste broker's survey can be used in lieu of a survey conducted by the licensee, provided the trade waste broker is registered with the commission. For customers who are charged on the basis of estimated weight, nothing in this section shall preclude such a customer's right to have its refuse accurately weighed during the survey period.

   (2) The licensee or customer may require a new survey of the customer's waste stream to be provided by the licensee in the manner described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision at no charge to the customer or to be conducted by a registered trade waste broker, provided that no more than two (2) surveys may be required within any twelve (12) month period.

   (3) A licensee shall not submit a false or misleading survey to a customer or prospective customer.

(d) Scales. Licensees who charge on the basis of the weight of a customer's waste shall use weighing devices, whether owned, rented or borrowed by the licensee, that are accurate to within five (5) percent. Licensees who use the services of a person or entity to weigh a customer's waste have the responsibility of insuring that the weighing devices used by such person or entity are accurate to within five (5) percent. The weight of a customer's waste shall be determined net of the weight of the can, container, dumpster or other rigid container in which it is placed by the customer.

(e) Charges by a licensee to a customer shall be based solely on volume or weight, and a licensee shall not charge an additional fee for services, materials or the use of a waste container or receptacle (except for compactors and roll-off boxes) provided by such licensee.

(f) No later than October 31 of every odd-numbered year, the Commission will hold a public hearing on the maximum rates charged by a licensee for the collection, removal, disposal, or recycling of trade waste. At least 30 days prior to the public hearing, the Commission will publish the date, time and location of the public hearing in the City Record and on the Commission website. At the hearing, proponents of a change in the maximum rates may submit oral or written testimony. The proponent of the rate change shall bear the burden of demonstrating, on an industry-wide basis, that existing rates are inconsistent with the standards for maximum rates set forth in § 16-519 of the Administrative Code.

(g) In determining whether the maximum rates charged by licensees for the collection, removal, disposal, or recycling of trade waste will be adjusted, the Commission shall not be limited to evidence provided by proponents of a rate change pursuant subdivision (f) of this section and may consider any relevant factor affecting the trade waste industry or its customers, including but not limited to:

   (1) The Producer Price Index (PPI), as published by the United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics;

   (2) Available data on the trade waste industry, including but not limited to:

      (a) Gross operating revenues (overall revenues);

      (b) Regulated service operating revenues (revenue generated from waste removal services associated with rate-regulated portion of business);

      (c) Net operating revenues;

      (d) Operating expenses;

      (e) Net regulated operating revenues;

      (f) Net regulated operating expenses;

      (g) Total regulated waste tonnage disposed;

   (3) Any other factor that may be relevant to assessing a fair and reasonable return to licensees and the protection of those using the services of such licensees from excessive or unreasonable charges.

*§ 5-05 Agreements and Contracts with Customers; Service to Customers.*


(a) Term and form of contract; requirements; service and discontinuation of service; increase of rates.

   (1) An oral agreement for the collection, removal, or disposal of trade waste shall be terminable at will by the customer and upon fourteen (14) days' written notice by the licensee. A contract for the collection, removal, or disposal of trade waste shall not exceed two (2) years in duration. A written contract for the removal, collection, or disposal of trade waste that contains no provision regarding duration shall be terminable at will by the customer and upon fourteen (14) days' written notice by the licensee. A written contract must provide that the licensee must remove the customer's waste from the location designated by the customer. A sample standard contract form must be submitted to the Commission when an application for a license is submitted, and a licensee must submit any subsequent changes in the standard form to the Commission thirty (30) days' prior to implementing such change. Nothing in this provision shall be construed to prevent a licensee from negotiating terms at variance with the standard form contract, except that a licensee must not vary such contract in any manner identified by the Commission as inconsistent with the purposes of Chapter 1 of Title 16-A of the Code by the Commission after review of such standard form.

   (2) A licensee must comply with the service and other terms set forth in the written contract or oral agreement with the customer, including the agreed-upon frequency and schedule for the collection of waste. A schedule agreed to in writing must not be altered without the written agreement of the customer's owner or authorized representative. When a licensee offers to provide a commercial establishment with trade waste services, the licensee must provide such customer with a copy of the Commission's informational notice to customers. The licensee must provide the customer with such additional informational notices as the Commission shall require throughout the term of service to the customer by the licensee.

   (3) A licensee must not discontinue service to any customer, or raise the rates charged to such customer, unless at least fourteen (14) days' written notice to the customer is given. No contract for the removal, collection, or disposal of waste shall provide that a licensee may discontinue service upon shorter notice.

   (4) A written contract that does not meet the requirements of Federal, State, or Local Law is voidable by either party.

(b) Subcontracting, assignment of contracts, mergers, and acquisitions.

   (1) A licensee must apply for review by the Commission before subcontracting or assigning a contract and must seek such review by the Commission thirty (30) days before such subcontract or assignment is proposed to take effect. The Commission may issue any order with respect to the transaction consistent with the purposes of Local Law 42. An assignee or subcontractor of contracts for the removal, collection, or disposal of trade waste notify, within fifteen (15) days of the effective date of such assignment or subcontract, each party to a contract so assigned of such assignment or subcontract and of the right of such party to terminate such contract upon thirty (30) days' notice during the three (3) months after receiving notice of such assignment or subcontract. Such notification must be by certified mail with the receipt of delivery retained by the assignee or subcontractor and must be upon a form approved by the Commission. Where no written contract exists with a customer for the removal, collection, or disposal of trade waste, a company that assumes such trade waste removal from another company must provide such customer with notification within fifteen (15) days of such assignment or subcontract, on a form approved by the Commission by certified mail with the receipt for delivery retained by the assignee or subcontractor, that a new company will be providing such trade waste removal, and that the customer has the right to terminate such service. A licensee must not enter into a subcontract before receiving express approval for the subcontracting arrangement from the Commission.

   (2) A licensee must apply for review by the Commission before acquiring, selling, or merging with another trade waste removal, collection, or disposal business and must seek such review by the Commission no later than thirty (30) days before such acquisition, sale, or merger is to take effect. The Commission may issue any order with respect to the intended transaction consistent with the purposes of Local Law 42. The Commission may, in its discretion, require that either the purchaser or seller post a bond or place money in escrow with the Commission in an amount that the Commission believes, in its discretion, is needed to cover any outstanding or potential fines or penalties owed or that may be owed to the Commission, any customer complaints that have been heard, pursuant to 17 RCNY § 1-03 in regard to which a final determination has not been rendered, and any restitution ordered by the Commission which the selling or dissolving licensee has failed to make to the customer. If the seller fails to post such bond or place money in escrow as set forth in this paragraph, the Commission may seek from the purchaser any and all outstanding fines or penalties for violations of Chapter 1 of Title 16-A of the Code and this chapter and any outstanding ordered customer restitution.

   (3) Investigation, inspection, and evaluation fee. The fee for investigation and review of any proposed transaction described in Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision shall be four thousand and five hundred dollars ($4,500) per entity involved and one thousand and two hundred dollars ($1,200) per principal involved. After submission to the Commission of an appropriate request for review of such a transaction, the Commission shall notify the parties to the transaction of the total fee amount due and owing, which must be paid in full within ten (10) days after such notification. The Commission, in its discretion, may waive or reduce fees upon written request in light of one (1) or more of the following reason(s):

      (i) specified persons or entities have recently undergone completed background investigations by the Commission;

      (ii) the value of the transaction under review is minimal;

      (iii) specified persons or entities need not undergo background investigations because of their attenuated connection to the transaction;

      (iv) the transaction does not involve the sale, assignment, or other transfer of any accounts or customer contracts (e.g., trucks or other non-customer assets);

      (v) the transaction involves less than five (5) customers;

      (vi) the transaction involves unique characteristics or other mitigating factors that would warrant a reduction or waiver of fees.

   (4) Requests for authorization of subcontracting, assignment, and other such arrangements. All trade waste subcontracting, assignment, and similar arrangements must be submitted to the Commission for authorization. Requests for approval of such an arrangement must be submitted in writing to the Commission, and the arrangement must not go forward unless and until it has been approved in advance by the Commission. The request must identify the customer(s) involved (including name, address, contact person, and contract terms), state the requested length of the arrangement, and describe the business justification for the arrangement. Copies of all affected contracts or proposed contracts must be submitted with the request.

   (5) Customer's thirty (30) day termination right during ninety (90) day post-assignment period. During the ninety (90) day period following the assignment or other transfer of a customer contract to another trade waste removal business, the customer has the right to terminate its carting contract on thirty (30) days' notice. All contracts signed by affected customers during the ninety (90) day period subsequent to contract assignment or transfer remain terminable on thirty (30) days' notice throughout the ninety (90) day period, and any such contract signed during that ninety (90) day period must contain prominent notice of this fact.

(c) Customer's contract termination right after denial of license application or revocation of license. During the ninety (90) day period following the effective date of the denial of the license application of a trade waste removal business or the revocation of the license of such a business, the customers of that business have the right to terminate any contracts for trade waste removal entered into during that period, on thirty (30) days' written notice to the other contracting party. Any contract for trade waste removal entered into by any such customer during the ninety (90) day post-denial period shall be terminable at will by the customer throughout that period on said written notice. Any such contract must contain prominent notice of the customer's right to terminate the contract at any time within such period upon such notice.

(d) Written contract. When service to a customer is commenced, the licensee must take all steps necessary to attempt to reach an agreement with the customer on the terms and conditions of the service to be provided and within forty (40) days of the commencement of service, must prepare a written contract that clearly and legibly sets forth the terms and conditions of the agreement negotiated by the licensee and the customer and deliver such contract to the customer. Such contract must provide that it shall be effective only upon being dated and signed by the licensee and the customer's owner or authorized representative and that a change of any term or condition of such contract must be made in writing, dated, and signed by both the licensee and the customer's owner or authorized representative before such term or condition takes effect. The proposed contract offered by the licensee be accompanied by a notice stating: "You are not required to sign this contract. If you have any questions or complaints, call the Business Integrity Commission at (212) 437-0600." One (1) copy of such signed and dated contract and a copy of any signed and dated amendments must be provided to the customer's owner or authorized representative by the licensee.

(e) Customer's decision not to sign a contract. A customer is not required to sign a contract. If a customer fails or refuses to sign a contract that has been tendered to the customer, pursuant to Subdivision c of this section, a licensee will be deemed to have complied with such subdivision if the licensee complies with the requirements in Paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subdivision provided, however, that a licensee must not discontinue service to such a customer, or raise the rates charged such a customer, unless at least fourteen (14) days' written notice of such discontinuance or rate increase was given to such customer. Where a written contract with a customer has not been obtained by the licensee, the licensee must:

   (1) demonstrate that a contract has been tendered to the customer in accordance with Subdivision c of this section, within forty (40) days of the commencement of service; and

   (2) keep a copy of the contract tendered on file along with the signed returned postal receipt for a period of one (1) year after the eventual discontinuance of service to the customer; and

   (3) make available to the Commission upon its request a copy of the contract and the return receipt.

*§ 11-12 Wholesale Trade Association Registration Required.*

*§ 11-13 Application for a Wholesale Trade Association Registration.*


(a) An application for a wholesale trade association registration pursuant to section 22-265 of the Code, or for a renewal of such registration, shall be made on a form prescribed by the Commission. The application shall be certified under penalty of perjury and signed by an officer of the applicant. The application shall include, but be not limited to, the following information:

   (1) the names of all members of such association;

   (2) the names of all persons holding office in such association; and

   (3) any criminal or civil investigation by a federal, state, or local prosecutorial, investigative or regulatory agency.

(b) An officer of a wholesale trade association required to be registered with the Commission pursuant to section 22-265 of the Code shall submit the information required by subdivision 22-265(b) of the Code on a form provided by the Commission.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter, when there is reasonable cause to believe that an officer of the trade association does not possess good character, honesty and integrity, the Commission may require that such officer be fingerprinted by a person designated for such purpose by the Commission, pay the fee prescribed by the Division of Criminal Justice Services for the purpose of obtaining criminal history records, and provide to the Commission the disclosure required by the form provided by the Commission. The Commission also may require such additional information, in lieu of or in addition to such fingerprinting and/or disclosure, including without limitation documents and an in-person interview, as the Commission determines is appropriate and reasonable to render a determination.

(d) After providing notice and opportunity to be heard, the Commission may disqualify an officer from holding office in a wholesale trade association based on the grounds set forth in subdivision c of section 22-265 of the Code and in accordance with the procedure for such disqualification set forth in such subdivision.

(e) If an application for the renewal of a registration is not submitted to the Commission within the time period required by the Commission, the Commission may reject the renewal application and require the applicant to file a new application for a wholesale trade association registration. If a new application is required by the Commission, the provisions pertaining to the application process as set forth in Chapter 1-B of Title 22 of the Code and of this subchapter shall govern.






*§ 11-14 Record Keeping Requirements for Wholesale Trade Associations.*

Electronic copies of such books and records shall be acceptable.

(b) Such books and records shall be made available for immediate inspection and/or copying upon request by the market manager, a designee of the market manager or an employee of the Commission.






*§ 11-15 Notification of Material Change in Information, Addition of Principal and Change in Composition of Business.*


(a) An applicant for a registration or a photo identification card shall notify the Commission within ten (10) calendar days of any material change in the information submitted in an application or disclosure form submitted pursuant to this subchapter. Subsequent to the issuance of the registration or photo identification card, the registrant or photo identification card holder shall notify the Commission within thirty (30) calendar days of any material change in the information submitted in an application or disclosure form.

(b) A registrant shall provide the Commission with notice of at least ten (10) business days of the proposed addition of a new principal (other than a person that becomes a principal through the acquisition of outstanding shares of a business whose equity securities are registered under Federal and State securities laws and publicly traded on a national or regional stock or security exchange). The Commission may waive or shorten such period upon a showing that there exists a bona fide business requirement therefor. Except where the Commission determines within such period, based upon information available to it, that the addition of such new principal may have a result inimical to the purposes of this subchapter, the registrant may add such new principal pending the completion of review by the Commission. The registrant shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the Commission that the addition of such new principal pending completion of such review would not have a result inimical to the purposes of this subchapter. If upon the completion of such review, the Commission determines that such principal lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the registration shall cease to be valid unless such principal divests his or her interest, or discontinues his or her involvement in the business of such registrant, as the case may be, within the time period prescribed by the Commission.

(c) The registrant shall also notify the Commission within thirty (30) days calendar days, of the ownership composition of the business.

(d) Any notification pursuant to this section shall be in writing, sworn and notarized.

(e) For the purposes of this section "material change" shall mean a change in any information provided in response to an item identified as such on an application or disclosure form submitted to the Commission or by any other directive issued by the Commission. "Material change" also includes the occurrence of any event after the submission of an application or disclosure that would have been required to be disclosed on such form had it occurred prior to such submission.






*§ 11-16 Acquisitions and Subleases.*


(a) A person who intends to acquire a registered wholesale business or market business shall submit an application for a wholesale business or market business registration pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 1-B of Title 22 of the Code and the rules set forth in this subchapter for a preliminary review of such application by the Commission. Upon the submission of purchase and sale agreement for review by the Commission no later than thirty (30) days before such acquisition or sale is to take effect, the Commission will conduct an expedited application review.

(b) A registrant shall notify the Commission within ten (10) calendar days of contract closing of any change in the capital stock or ownership in the business of the registrant, including but not limited to a stock transfer or sale of the outstanding shares of the business or sale or merger of such business; provided, however, that a business whose equity securities are publicly traded on a national or regional stock or securities exchange shall be required to make disclosure of only such stock transfer or sale required to be disclosed by the Securities Exchange Commission or other Federal or State regulatory body. Such notification shall include a list of any persons formerly possessing ownership interest in the registrant business who will have any beneficial interest in the current business and a copy of the contract or agreement.

(c) Sublessee required to apply for registration. Wholesale businesses and market businesses shall not allow the use by any other person of the registration number or the name of the business to which such registration number has been issued. In the event that a wholesale business or market business seeks to sublease or otherwise allow the use of its premises, or any portion thereof, for the operation of a wholesale business or market business by another person, where such sublease is permitted under the terms of the lease, the Commission may, upon application and payment of the required fee by the prospective sublessee pursuant to the provisions of chapter 1-B of Title 22 of the Code and the rules set forth in this subchapter, issue a registration number to such sublessee. Absent such registration number no wholesale business or market business may permit a sublessee to operate a wholesale business or market business on such premises.






*§ 11-17 Refusal to Issue Registration or Photo Identification Card; Revocation and Suspension of Registration or Photo Identification Card.*


(a) Where the staff of the Commission recommends that the Commission refuse, pursuant to section 22-259 of the Code, to issue a registration to a wholesale business or market business applicant or a photo identification card applicant, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the reasons for the proposed refusal of such registration or photo identification card and that the applicant may, within ten (10) business days of the date of such notification, respond in writing to the Commission setting forth the reasons such applicant believes that it should not be denied such registration or photo identification card. In the exercise of its discretion, the Commission, considering the reasons for the proposed refusal to issue the registration or photo identification card, the nature of the issues raised in connection therewith, and the response submitted by the applicant, may make a final determination regarding the issuance of such registration or photo identification card or afford the applicant such further opportunity to be heard in such proceeding as is deemed appropriate. A final determination and the reasons therefor shall be communicated to the applicant in writing.

(b) The Commission may revoke a temporary photo identification card, and after notice and hearing, revoke or suspend the registration of a wholesale business or market business or a photo identification card for any of the reasons set forth in section 22-260 of the Code, or for violation of any rule promulgated pursuant to section 22-266 of the Code, including without limitation 17 RCNY § 11-19. Notice shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of 17 RCNY § 11-20. Hearings shall be afforded in accordance with the provisions of 17 RCNY § 11-21.

(c) Revocation or suspension of a registration, discontinuance of business operations in the market area by a registrant, or denial of an application for registration shall require the immediate surrender to the market manager of all photo identification cards issued to the principals, employees and/or agents of the registrant. Violation of the provisions of this subdivision may result in immediate revocation of a suspended registration and/or the imposition of sanctions and penalties as provided in section 22-258 of the Code.

(d) Revocation or suspension of photo identification cards or denial of an application for a photo identification card (including temporary photo identification cards) shall require the immediate surrender of such cards to the market manager.






*§ 11-18 Emergency Suspension of Registration or Photo Identification Card.*


Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Chairperson may, if he or she has reasonable cause to believe that the operation of a wholesale business or market business or the presence of any person in the public wholesale market creates an imminent danger to life or property or to the orderly and lawful operation of the market, or that there has likely been false or fraudulent information submitted to the Commission, immediately suspend the registration of such business or the photo identification card of such person without a prior hearing, provided that such suspension may be appealed to the Deputy Commissioner for Legal Affairs of the Commission who shall determine such appeal forthwith. If the Deputy Commissioner for Legal Affairs upholds the suspension, an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (b) of 17 RCNY § 11-21 shall be provided on an expedited basis. The Commission shall issue a final determination no later than four (4) business days following the conclusion of such hearing. The Chairperson may, upon application by a wholesale business or market business whose registration has been suspended without a prior hearing, permit such business to remain in the market for such time as is necessary to allow for the expeditious sale, consignment or removal of a perishable product if, in the Commission's judgment, such permission is consistent with the safety of the market.

Any person who violates any such provision shall be subject to the civil and criminal fines and penalties and injunctive relief as provided in section 22-258 of the Code.

(b) A wholesale business, market business, or wholesale trade association shall be jointly and severally liable for any violation of Chapter l-B of Title 22 of the Code or of this subchapter committed by any of its officers, employees and/or agents acting within the scope of their employment.

(c) All penalties are in dollar amounts. Repeat penalties apply to violations of the same subdivision penalty schedule description. Second, third, fourth, fifth and subsequent (“subs.”) violations are defined as a violation by the same respondent on a date within five years of the date of occurrence of the previous violation.

Where a mail-in penalty exists in this penalty schedule for the cited violation, a respondent may admit to the violation charged and pay the penalty by mail in the manner and time directed by the summons. Payment in full is deemed an admission of liability and no further hearing or appeal will be allowed. Where a respondent is permitted to admit and pay by mail but fails to do so prior to the original hearing date written on the violation, the respondent will have the option of paying the mail-in penalty, plus a late admit fee of $30.00, within 30 days of the mailing date of the default order issued against respondent.

*§ 12-21 Notification of Material Change in Information, Addition of Principal and Change in Composition of Business.*


(a) An applicant for a license, registration or a photo identification card shall notify the Commission within ten (10) calendar days of any material change in the information submitted in an application or disclosure form.

The Commission may waive or shorten such period upon a showing that there exists a bona fide business requirement therefor. Except where the Commission determines within such period, based upon information available to it, that the addition of such new principal may have a result inimical to the purposes of this subchapter, the licensee or registrant may add such new principal pending the completion of review by the Commission. The licensee or registrant shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the Commission that the addition of such new principal pending completion of such review would not have a result inimical to the purposes of this subchapter. If upon the completion of such review, the Commission determines that such principal lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the license or registration shall cease to be valid unless such principal divests his or her interest, or discontinues his or her involvement in the business of such licensee or registrant, as the case may be, within the time period prescribed by the Commission.

(d) Any notification pursuant to this section shall be in writing, sworn and notarized.

(e) For the purposes of this section "material change" shall mean a change in any information provided in response to an item identified as such on an application or disclosure form submitted to the Commission or by any other directive issued by the Commission.

*§ 12-22 Acquisitions and Subleases.*


(a) A person who intends to acquire a registered wholesale seafood business or a seafood delivery business shall submit an application for a wholesale seafood business or seafood delivery business registration pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 1-A of Title 22 of the Code and this subchapter and a purchase and sale agreement for review by the Commission no later than thirty (30) days before such acquisition is to take effect. The Commission will conduct an expedited review of such application and agreement. If the person seeking to acquire the wholesale seafood business or seafood delivery business currently holds a registration for another such business in a market, the Commission at its discretion may waive the requirement of a new application or require that only certain portions of the application be submitted for review.

(b) A loading or unloading licensee or a wholesale seafood business or seafood delivery business registrant shall notify the Commission within ten (10) calendar days of contract closing of any change in the capital stock or ownership in the business of the licensee or registrant, including but not limited to a stock transfer or sale of the outstanding shares of the business or sale or merger of such business; provided, however that a business whose equity securities are publicly traded on a national or regional stock or securities exchange shall be required to make disclosure of only such stock transfer or sale required to be disclosed by the Securities Exchange Commission or other Federal or State regulatory body. Such notification shall include a list of any persons formerly possessing ownership interest in the registrant business who will have any beneficial interest in the current business and a copy of the contract or agreement.

(c) Sublessee required to apply for registration. Wholesale seafood businesses and seafood delivery businesses shall not allow the use by any other person of the registration or registration number or the name of the business to which such registration has been issued. In the event that a wholesale seafood business seeks to sublease or otherwise allow the use of its premises, or any portion thereof, for the operation of a wholesale seafood business by another person, where such sublease is permitted under the terms of the lease, the Commission may, upon application and payment of the required fee by the prospective sublessee pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 1-A of Title 22 of the Code and this subchapter, issue a registration to such sublessee. Absent such registration, no wholesale seafood business may permit a sublessee to operate a wholesale seafood business on such premises.

(a) Where the staff of the Commission recommends that the Commission refuse, pursuant to section 22-216 of the Code, to issue a license, registration or photo identification card, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the reasons for the proposed refusal and may, within ten (10) business days of the date of such notification, respond in writing to the Commission setting forth the reasons such applicant believes that it should not be denied such license, registration or photo identification card. In the exercise of its discretion, the Commission, considering the reasons for the proposed refusal to issue the license, registration or photo identification card, the nature of the issues raised in connection therewith, and the response submitted by the applicant, may make a final determination regarding the issuance of such license, registration or photo identification card or afford the applicant such further opportunity to be heard in such proceeding as is deemed appropriate. A final determination and the reasons therefor shall be communicated to the applicant in writing.

(b) For any of the reasons set forth in sections 22-216 and 22-217 of the Code, including the violation of any rule promulgated pursuant to section 22-223 of the Code, the Commission may suspend or revoke a provisional photo identification card, and after notice and hearing, revoke or suspend

Violation of the provisions of this subdivision may result in the imposition of the sanctions and penalties provided in sections 22-215 and 22-219 of the Code.

(d) Revocation or suspension of a photo identification card or denial of an application for a photo identification card (including provisional photo identification cards) shall require the immediate surrender of such card to the market manager.






*§ 12-24 Emergency Suspension of License, Registration or Photo Identification Card.*


Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Chairperson may, if he or she has reasonable cause to believe that the operation of a loading or unloading business, a wholesale seafood business or seafood delivery business or the presence of any person in the market area creates an imminent danger to life or property or to the orderly and lawful operation of the market, or that there has likely been false or fraudulent information submitted to the Commission, may immediately suspend the license or registration of such business or the photo identification card of such person without a prior hearing, provided that such suspension may be appealed to the Deputy Commissioner for Legal Affairs of the Commission, who shall determine such appeal forthwith. If the Deputy Commissioner for Legal Affairs upholds the suspension, an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to the provisions of 17 RCNY § 12-26(b) shall be provided on an expedited basis. The Commission shall issue a final determination no later than four (4) business days following the conclusion of such hearing. The Chairperson may, upon application by the business whose license or registration has been suspended, permit such business to remain in the market area for such time as is deemed necessary by the Chairperson to allow for the expeditious sale, consignment or removal of a perishable product if, in the Chairperson's judgment, such permission is consistent with the safety of the market area.






*§ 12-25 Notice.*


Unless otherwise provided, all notices, pursuant to Chapter 1-A of Title 22 of the Code or this subchapter, including but not limited to notice related to hearings, violations, and subpoenae, may be served by first class mail addressed to the business address provided to the Commission by the applicant, licensee, registrant, or photo identification card holder.

      (ii) All parties shall be afforded due process of law, including the opportunity to be represented by counsel, to issue subpoenas or request that a subpoena be issued, to call and examine witnesses and to present arguments on the law and facts. Relevant material and reliable evidence may be admitted without regard to technical or formal rules or laws of evidence.

The Commission shall then make its final determination and notify the respondent of such determination. When the hearing is conducted by the Commission, the Commission shall make a final determination and notify the respondent of such determination.

      (vii) Failure of a respondent to make a timely written response, appear or proceed as required by the hearing officer or the Commission, as the case may be, shall constitute a default.

The Commission shall then make a final determination and shall notify the respondent of such determination.
