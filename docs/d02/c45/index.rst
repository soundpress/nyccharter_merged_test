**Subchapter C: Implementation**



*§ 5-71 Implementation by Eligible Redistributor of Energy or Qualified Eligible Redistributor of Energy.*


(a) An eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall reduce the energy services bills rendered to eligible revitalization area energy users that are not directly metered and that occupy, operate or manage premises in eligible buildings owned or leased by such redistributor by an amount equal, in the aggregate, to one hundred percent (100%) of each special rebate received by such redistributor.

(b) An eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall individually and accurately meter or submeter the energy services sold or otherwise redistributed by such redistributor to each such eligible revitalization area energy user or other occupant of eligible buildings so as to enable a determination of each such user's or occupant's usage of energy services, provided such user or occupant occupies, operates or manages premises that equal or exceed the lesser of ten thousand (10,000) contiguous square feet in area or the entire floor of a building.

(c) In order to establish the usage of energy services attributable to the tenants occupying an eligible building, an eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall have a load study performed by a licensed professional engineer on all non-eligible users that are not individually metered or submetered. In addition, such redistributor shall have all of the submeters attributable to non-eligible users read by a licensed professional engineer.

(d) If an eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy charges amounts to eligible revitalization area energy users and other users that vary annually or more frequently with the costs incurred by such redistributor for the operation of common areas, systems and facilities, such redistributor shall reduce such charges by the portion of the special rebates attributable thereto.

(e) An eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall allocate the reductions required by subdivision (a) of this 66 RCNY § 5-71 in direct proportion to each such eligible revitalization area energy user's use of energy services. Such reductions shall be determined as follows:

   (1) The total amount of such redistributor's energy services bill shall be divided by the total amount of kilowatt hours used by the eligible building to determine the cost per kilowatt hour charge for the eligible building;

   (2) If the premises of such eligible revitalization area energy user or other user are submetered, such reduction shall be established by multiplying: (A) the amount of energy services use determined by such submeter; by (B) the dollar per kilowatt charge determined in (1) above; by (C) the amount of the special rebate set forth in 66 RCNY § 5-65 or 66 RCNY § 5-67;

   (3) If two or more eligible revitalization area energy users or other users share a submeter, the amount of the reduction to be shared by the eligible revitalization area energy users shall be determined in accordance with (2) above. This amount shall then be allocated among such users in direct proportion to the floor area of the premises occupied, operated or managed by each such user;

   (4) If the premises of such eligible revitalization area energy user is not required to be submetered by these rules, such discount shall be determined as follows:

(A) Divide the portion of the special rebate received by all submetered eligible revitalization area energy users by their total square footage to determine the special rebate per square footage amount; and

(B) Multiply the special rebate per square footage amount determined in (A) above by the square footage of each non-submetered eligible revitalization area energy user to determine the amount of the special rebate each such non-submetered eligible revitalization area energy user is entitled to;

   (5) The special rebate to be applied to common areas, systems and facilities shall be the total rebate received by the eligible building less: (A) the total special rebate received by each submetered eligible revitalization area energy user as determined in (2) above; and (B) the total special rebate received by each submetered eligible revitalization area energy user sharing a submeter as determined in (3) above; and (C) the total special rebate received by all non-submetered eligible revitalization area energy users as determined in (4) above.

(f) If the premises of an eligible revitalization area energy user are directly metered, such discount shall be determined by such meter.

(g) An eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall limit charges to those eligible revitalization area energy users that are submetered in accordance with this section to a price for the purchase of energy services that shall be no higher than the price paid by such redistributor, provided that an additional fee, not exceeding twelve percent (12%) of such sales price, may be charged by such redistributor for energy services sold to such eligible revitalization area energy users.

(h) An eligible redistributor of energy or a qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall separately state in all energy bills rendered by such redistributor to an eligible revitalization area energy user for sales of energy services the amount of the reduction in charges for such services representing the share of the special rebate allocated to such user, or that no reduction has been made, and shall state the following: "You may be entitled to share a rebate which your landlord has received for charges for energy services pursuant to the revitalization area energy rebate program. The amount is separately stated and identified in this bill." Any deviation from this language must be approved in advance by DBS.

(i) An eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall keep records verifying compliance with the requirements of LMEP, and allow DBS access to such records.

(j) An eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall provide access to eligible buildings or targeted eligible buildings to DBS for the purpose of inspecting meters, submeters and other equipment and verifying the accuracy of any application or supplement thereto filed with DBS and DOF.






*§ 5-72 Implementation by a Utility and NYCPUS.*


(a) Where a utility or NYCPUS is required to make a special rebate pursuant to 66 RCNY § 5-65 or 66 RCNY § 5-67, they shall reduce each energy services bill for each eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy or directly metered eligible revitalization area energy user by the full amount of the special rebate that shall have accrued for the period covered by each such energy services bill. A utility or NYCPUS shall cease to make such reductions in such energy services bills upon receipt of notification from DBS that the certification of eligibility has been suspended or terminated, and a utility or NYCPUS shall change the amount of such reduction in accordance with notification from DBS.

(b) A utility shall not be required to make a special rebate to such eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy in excess of the charges for energy services.

      (ii) Before the contract may be awarded, each proposed construction contractor for a contract in excess of $1 million is required to submit to the Division an Employment Report for its principal place of business or headquarters, the construction site where the contract will be performed and other non-City funded construction sites of the contractor within the City;

      (iii) A contracting agency may award a requirements contract or an open market purchase agreement covered by these regulations prior to review by the Division of the contractor's Employment Report but may not make a purchase order against such contract or agreement until it has first transmitted such contractor's Employment Report to the Division and the Division has completed its review.

   (2) Unless otherwise provided by federal or state law, an Employment Report shall not be required for

      (i) a construction contract in the amount of $1 million or less or construction subcontract in the amount of $750,000 or less; or

      (ii) a supply and service contract or subcontract in the amount of the small purchase limit established by rule of the Procurement Policy Board for procurement for goods and services or less or where the contractor employs less than 50 employees. In such cases the contracting agency shall promptly notify the Office in writing prior to the award of such a contract. To determine the applicability of this paragraph (2) to a City-assisted construction contract, the amount or value of the City assistance shall govern; or

      (iii) an emergency contract or other exempt contract except as the Division may direct by regulation; or

      (iv) a contract with a contractor who has received a certificate of compliance with the equal employment opportunity requirements of applicable law from the Division within the preceding thirty-six months, or an appropriate agency of the State of New York or of the United States within the preceding thirty-six months, except as the Division may direct by regulation; or

      (v) a contract for a procurement of information technology that is within the small purchase limits established by rule of the Procurement Policy Board.

      (vi) a contract for Client Services, as defined above; except that nothing in this section shall prevent the Commissioner in the Commissioner's sole discretion from requiring an employment report from a Client Services agency that has contracted with the City if the Commissioner believes that the Client Services agency is in violation of the equal employment requirements of City, State or Federal law.

   (3) Unless otherwise provided by law, an Employment Report shall not be required on a preaward basis for an emergency contract awarded pursuant to Executive Order No. 2 (2nd) (1970), as amended, the City Charter § 315 or the General Municipal Law § 103(4). In such cases, the contracting agency shall promptly notify the Office of the award of such a contract by submission of a copy of the documentation submitted to the Law Department. In the event of an emergency not covered under the foregoing provisions, the contracting agency head will notify the Director in writing requesting a waiver of the preaward submission requirements. Said request must contain a statement of reason for such waiver request.

   (4) Unless otherwise required by law, an Employment Report shall not be required for a covered supply and service contract with a contractor who has received a valid certificate of compliance with the equal employment requirement of applicable law as follows: (i) where a contractor has received a Certificate of Equal Employment Compliance issued after a desk audit by an appropriate federal or state agency in the preceding 12 months, the proposed contractor shall complete and submit the general information section of the Employment Report with a copy of such certificate of compliance to the Division;

      (ii) where a contractor has been desk audited by an appropriate government agency and found to have deficiencies with respect to equal employment compliance and has agreed, within the preceding 12 months, to correct these deficiencies, the contractor may submit the general information section of the Employment Report with documentation regarding the finding of deficiencies and corrective measures taken. The Division may thereafter, in its discretion, require the submission of all reports concerning implementation of corrective measures or a completed Employment Report; and

      (iii) where a contractor has been reviewed by the Division and issued a certificate of compliance in the preceding 12 months, the contractor shall complete and submit the general information section of the Employment Report with a copy of such certificate of compliance to the Division.

   (5) Unless otherwise required by law, the Division may in its discretion waive the submission of an Employment Report where the contractor is in the process of being desk audited by an appropriate government agency and grant the contractor a conditional approval. Upon completion of the audit, the contractor must advise the Bureau of the results of the audit. The Division may thereafter in its discretion, require the submission of all reports concerning implementation of corrective measures or a completed Employment Report.

   (6) The contractor may at its option submit its existing Affirmative Action Plan ("Plan") in lieu of parts of the Employment Report, provided that the Plan contains essentially the same information as those portions of the Employment Report.

   (7) The contractor may at its option submit copies of its self-evaluation and transition plans written pursuant to § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

   (8) The Director may, on the written request of the contracting agency head, waive the submission requirements of E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations where the agency head certifies that:

      (i) the contracting agency has been unable to secure the submission of an employment report after making diligent efforts; and

      (ii) the proposed contractor is the sole provider of a unique service, supply or labor; or

      (iii) because of the unique circumstances of the contract it would not be in the public interest to require submission of an Employment Report prior to the award of the contract.

   (9) Failure to file timely, complete and accurate reports as required by E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations constitutes noncompliance with E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations. The Director may direct the contracting agency head to impose sanctions authorized by E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations in connection with such noncompliance. The Division shall notify the contracting agency in writing of any such failure as soon as practicable.






*§ 10-04 Responsibilities of Contracting Agencies.*


(a)  Contract language – all contracts. Each contracting agency shall incorporate into every contract in excess of the small purchase limit established by rule of the Procurement Policy Board to which it becomes a party the following language: "This contract is subject to the requirements of Executive Order No. 50  (66 RCNY § 10-14) ("E.O. 50") and the Rules and Regulations promulgated thereunder. No contract will be awarded unless and until these requirements have been complied with in their entirety. By signing this contract, the contractor agrees that it:

   (1) will not discriminate unlawfully against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, handicap, marital status, sexual orientation or citizenship status with respect to all employment decisions including, but not limited to recruitment, hiring, upgrading, demotion, downgrading, transfer, training, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, layoff, termination, and all other terms and conditions of employment;

   (2) will not discriminate in the selection of subcontractors on the basis of the owner's, partners' or shareholders' race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, handicap, marital status, sexual orientation or citizenship status;

   (3) will state in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of the contractor that all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, handicap, marital status, sexual orientation or citizenship status or is an equal employment opportunity employer;

   (4) will send to each labor organization or representative of workers with which it has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or memorandum of understanding, written notification of its equal employment opportunity commitments under E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder;

   (5) will furnish before the contract is awarded all information and reports including an Employment Report which are required by E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and orders of the Director of the Office of Labor Services ("Division"). Copies of all required reports are available upon request from the contracting agency; and

   (6) will permit the Division to have access to all relevant books, records and accounts by the Division for the purposes of investigation to ascertain compliance with such rules, regulations, and orders. The contractor understands that in the event of its noncompliance with the nondiscrimination clauses of this contract or with any of such rules, regulations, or orders, such noncompliance shall constitute a material breach of the contract and noncompliance with E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. After a hearing held pursuant to the rules of the Division, the Director may direct the imposition by the contracting agency head of any or all of the following sanctions:

      (i) disapproval of the contractor;

      (ii) suspension or termination of the contract;

      (iii) declaring the contractor in default; or

      (iv) in lieu of any of the foregoing sanctions, the Director may impose an employment program. The Director of the Division may recommend to the contracting agency head that a contractor who has repeatedly failed to comply with E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder be determined to be nonresponsible. The contractor agrees to include the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs in every subcontract or purchase order in excess of the small purchase limit established by rule of the Procurement Policy Board to which it becomes a party unless exempted by E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as may be directed by the Director of the Division of Labor Services as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for noncompliance. The contractor further agrees that it will refrain from entering into any contract or contract modification subject to E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with a subcontractor who is not in compliance with the requirements of E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder."

(b) Special provisions for construction contracts. In addition to the contractual provisions required in 66 RCNY § 10-04(a), each contracting agency shall incorporate into every contract for a construction project in excess of $125,000 to which it becomes a party the following language: "The contractor further agrees that it shall employ trainees for training level jobs and it shall participate in on-the-job training programs other than apprenticeship programs which are approved by the Division and where required by law, the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship Training or the New York State Department of Labor. The contractor shall make a good faith effort to achieve the ratio of one (1) trainee to four (4) journey-level employees of each trade on each construction project; provided, that the trainee requirement shall not apply to contracts in the amount of $125,000 or less. "Trainee" means an economically disadvantaged person who qualifies for and receives training in one of the construction trades pursuant to a program, other than an apprenticeship program, approved by the Division and, where required by law, the New York State Department of Labor and the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. The contractor shall be considered to employ 4 journey-level employees in a particular trade when he or she employs any number of journey-level employees in that craft whose aggregate work hours equal the number of hours 4 full-time journey-level employees would have worked in a work week as defined by the prevailing practice in the industry for the particular craft, i.e., 40 hours, 37 1/2 hours, 35 hours, etc. For example, in a craft where there is a forty-hour work week, the employment of 4 journey-level employees results in 160 hours of employment (4 × 40). Hence, any number of journey-level employees which results in 160 hours of work is considered for purposes of the training program to equal 4 journey-level employees, i.e., 3 journey-level employees who work 53 1/3 hours (3 × 53 1/3 = 160). The training requirement shall not apply to any trade in which the employment of four or more journey-level employees and the trainee shall be for less than 4 consecutive weeks; provided, that 4 weeks shall mean 4 weeks of full-time work as defined by the prevailing practice in the industry for the particular craft, i.e., 160 hours (4 weeks × 40 hours), 150 hours (4 weeks × 37 1/2 hours), 140 hours (4 weeks × 35 hours), etc. The contractor shall attempt to provide continuous employment for trainees after the completion of the contract to enable them to complete their course of training. Union contractors shall refer, recommend and sponsor for union membership any of their trainees who can perform the duties of a qualified journey-level employee or who have satisfactorily completed the training program. Such former trainee shall be paid full journey-level wages and fringe benefits, whether or not union membership is granted after such referral, recommendation or sponsorship, and the contractor shall attempt to continue the employment of such persons. In the event of a failure to provide training to the required number of trainees for the required number of weeks, the contractor's compensation shall be decreased by an amount equal to the difference between the wages and fringe benefits paid by the contractor to the trainees and the wages and fringe benefits which would have been paid to the trainees had the number and duration of the positions been as required unless the contractor can demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to provide training and was unsuccessful. The wages and fringes deducted will be whatever a first term trainee would have received under the prevailing wage schedule in effect at the time the trainees should have been employed. A good faith effort includes at least:

   (i) documented efforts to secure trainees from approved training programs; and

   (ii) documented outreach efforts to New York State Employment Service, Department of Employment, TAP Centers, community and civil rights groups to identify candidates for training positions and sponsorship of those persons by the contractor for entrance into an approved training program; and

   (iii) written notification to the Division that the contractor has been unable to secure trainees pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) above and requesting the Division's assistance in securing trainees; provided, that neither the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement nor the refusal by a union with whom the contractor has a collective bargaining agreement to recognize the validity of the training program shall excuse the contractor's obligation to provide training pursuant to E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these reg- ulations. To demonstrate its good faith effort, the contractor may at its option supply documentation concerning its employment of trainees on all its construction sites, both City and non-City funded. The Division will review this documentation as part of its analysis to determine whether the contractor made a good faith effort. The contractor will also include the training provisions of this section in every subcontract in excess of $125,000 to which it becomes a party unless exempted by E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract as the Division may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions, including sanctions for noncompliance. The contractor further agrees that it will assist and cooperate with the Division in obtaining the compliance of subcontractors with the requirements of E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and it will furnish the Division with information necessary for supervision of such compliance."

(c) Special provisions for city-assisted contracts. [Reserved.]

(d) Preaward compliance generally. 

   (1) No contracting agency shall enter into a construction contract in excess of $1 million, or a supply and service contract in excess of the small purchase limit established by rule of the Procurement Policy Board for procurement for goods and services when the contractor employs 50 or more employees, unless the contractor's Employment Report is first submitted to the Division for its review and approval.

   (2) The contracting agency, at the time a proposed covered contractor is identified, either through low bid or negotiation, shall notify the Division in writing of the name of the proposed contractor, the contract in question and dollar amount.

   (3) The contracting agency shall transmit a completed Employment Report to the Division within ten business days after the identification of a proposed covered contractor.

   (4) The contracting agency may thereafter award a contract, unless the Division gives prior written notice to the contracting agency and the contractor as follows:

      (i) If the Division notifies the contracting agency and the contractor within five business days after the receipt by the Division of the Employment Report that the contractor has failed to submit a complete report, the Director may require the contracting agency to disapprove the contractor unless such deficiency is corrected in a timely manner; and

      (ii) If the Division notifies the contracting agency and the contractor within fifteen business days of the receipt by the Division of the completed Employment Report that the Division's analysis of the contractor's workforce indicates underutilization and therefore the Division has reason to believe that the contractor is not in substantial compliance with applicable legal requirements and the provisions of E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations, the Division shall promptly take such action as may be necessary to remedy the contractor's noncompliance. These time limits shall apply to the review of all Employment Reports submitted by subcontractors or contractors who are a party to a requirements contract or an open market purchase agreement.

      (iii) The time limits for this subdivision (d) begin to run on the business day following receipt of the Employment Report.

   (5) The contracting agency shall notify the Division in writing of the award of a covered contract.

   (6) With respect to covered supply and service contracts, the contracting agency shall also:

      (i) notify the Division upon the submission of the prime contractor's Employment Report of any subcontracts in excess of the small purchase limit established by rule of the Procurement Policy Board for procurements for goods and services where the subcontractor employs 50 or more employees; and

      (ii) transmit the subcontractor's completed Employment Report to the Division for review and approval.

   (7) With respect to covered construction contracts, the contracting agency shall in addition:

      (i) notify the Division in writing of its commencement to work order;

      (ii) notify the Division in writing of the contractor's application for approval of subcontractors and transmit to the Division the subcontractors' completed Employment Reports for review and approval before allowing the contractor to subcontract any work; and

      (iii) notify the Division in writing when the contract is 98 percent complete.






*§ 10-05 Responsibilities of the Division of Labor Services.*


(a) Division review – generally.

   (1) It shall be the responsibility of the Division to implement, monitor compliance with, and enforce E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14), these regulations and programs established pursuant to City, State and Federal law requiring contractors to provide equal employment opportunity.

   (2) The Division shall conduct a preaward compliance review to determine whether the contractor maintains nondiscriminatory hiring and employment practices and is taking steps to insure that applicants are employed and that employees are placed, trained, upgraded, promoted, paid, and otherwise treated during employment without regard to race, creed, color, sex, national origin, age, handicap, marital status, sexual orientation or citizenship status.

   (3) The Division's preaward compliance review shall proceed in the following manner:

      (i) The Division shall analyze the contractor's Employment Report, with special attention directed to the composition of the work force and the contractor's employment policies, practices and procedures, including the following: recruitment, outreach, interviewing practices, pre-employment physical exams, employee evaluations, supervisor accountability, EEO training, promotional and transfer practices, training programs, employee counseling, job descriptions, architectural and other barriers, salaries and wage plans, fringe benefits, work environment, changing facilities, and collective bargaining agreements;

      (ii) If the Division deems it appropriate as part of its compliance review, or if the Office finds that the material submitted is incomplete or raises questions concerning the contractor's efforts to meet the requirements of E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations, the Division may:

(A) hold a conference with the contractor to gain information necessary to complete the compliance review and, where necessary, to develop an Employment Program; and

(B) perform an on site review of those matters which were not fully or satisfactorily addressed in the Employment Report or at the conference.

      (iii) The Division will take into consideration consent decrees, court and administrative orders and conciliation agreements when analyzing a contractor's compliance with E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations. The Division will not impose requirements which are inconsistent with the foregoing.

(b) Division review – supply and services contracts.

   (1) After the Division has completed its preaward compliance review and has determined that a proposed covered contractor is in compliance with the requirements of E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations, it shall issue a certificate of compliance which shall be valid for 36 months.

   (2) After the Division has completed its preaward compliance review and has identified underutilization or employment policies and practices which mitigate against equal employment opportunity, it may negotiate an Employment Program or approve the proposed covered contractor with reservations and monitor the compliance of the contractor with E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations during the term of the contract. The monitoring shall consist of:

      (i) an analysis of Employment Update Reports which the contractor is required to submit on a periodic basis; and

      (ii) where necessary, conferences and on site reviews.

(c) Division review – construction contracts.

   (1) During the preaward compliance review, the Division shall hold a preaward conference for contracts in excess of $1,000,000. At the conference, the Division will review the contents of the Employment Report in detail with the contractor to insure compliance with applicable Federal, State, and City equal employment opportunity and training requirements. The Division shall, thereafter, issue a certificate of compliance which shall be valid for thirty-six months.

   (2) During the term of the contract, the Division shall monitor the compliance of the contractor with the requirements of E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations. The monitoring shall consist of:

      (i) an analysis of the payroll records or other workforce data tables on City and non-City funded sites which the contractor is required to submit on a periodic basis; and

      (ii) field visits to City and non-City funded construction sites of the contractor within the City.

   (3) Upon completion of the contract and prior to final payment, the Division shall complete the audit of the contractor's payroll records and any other information submitted concerning compliance with the training requirements of E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations to determine whether the contractor has made a good faith effort to comply with these requirements and whether the contractor's compensation should be reduced for failure to provide the required training. The contractor and the contracting agency shall be given notice if the Division's audit reveals that the contractor failed to provide training for the required number of trainees for the required number of weeks, or that the contractor has acted to circumvent the training requirements. In such case, unless the contractor can demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to provide the training, the contractor's compensation will be reduced. The Division shall evaluate all information submitted by the contractor concerning its good faith effort and consult with the contracting agency before a decision is made as to whether a training violation has occurred. The Division shall notify the contractor and contracting agency of its determination.

(d) [Reserved.]






*§ 10-06 Criteria for Compliance – Generally.*


The Division shall determine the contractor's compliance status after analysis of the composition of its work force and its employment policies and practices using the criteria enumerated in this section. In the event the analysis reveals that the contractor has not met the requirements of E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations, the Division may with the contractor develop an Employment Program to correct any underutilization or employment policies and practices which mitigate against equal employment-opportunity. The Employment Program shall consist of mandated actions based upon the criteria set forth in this section.

(a) Equal employment opportunity policy statement.

   (1) All covered contractors must have a written equal employment opportunity policy which indicates the chief executive Divisionr's commitment to equal employment opportunity, assigns overall responsibility for implementation and provides for a reporting and monitoring procedure.

   (2) The contractor shall disseminate its equal employment opportunity policy internally as follows:

      (i) Include the policy in employee and supervisor manuals;

      (v) Post the policy on company bulletin boards.

   (3) The contractor shall disseminate its equal employment opportunity policy externally as follows:

      (i) Inform all recruiting sources verbally and in writing of company policy, stipulating that these sources actively recruit and refer members of all protected groups for all positions;

      (ii) Incorporate the equal employment opportunity policy into all purchase orders, contracts, etc., covered by E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations; and

      (iii) Communicate the policy in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of the contractor.

   (4) An executive of the contractor shall be appointed as director or manager of company equal employment programs with sufficient resources to carry out the responsibility. His or her identity should appear on all internal and external communications on the company's equal employment policy and programs. His or her responsibilities should include:

      (i) Developing policy statements, equal employment programs, internal and external communication techniques and programs;

      (ii) Assisting in the identification of problem areas;

      (iii) Assisting line management in arriving at solutions to problems;

      (iv) Designing and implementing audit and reporting systems that will

(A) Measure effectiveness of the contractor's policy and implementing programs including supervisors' and management's adherence to the equal employment opportunity policy;

   (1) All covered contractors must complete and submit an Employment Report. The Employment Report must contain specific information concerning the composition of the contractor's current and projected workforce.

   (2) The Division shall analyze the data on minorities and women submitted by the contractor with respect to all job groups. In determining whether minorities or women are being underutilized in any job group, the Division may consider the following factors:

      (i) The minority or female population of the labor area surrounding the facility or the construction site;

      (ii) The size of the minority or female unemployed work force in the labor or recruitment area surrounding the facility or the construction site;

      (iii) The percentage of the minority or female workforce as compared with the total workforce in the immediate labor area;

      (iv) The general availability of minorities or females having requisite skills in the immediate labor area;

      (v) The availability of minorities or women having requisite skills in an area in which the contractor can reasonably recruit;

      (vi) The availability of promotable and transferable minorities or women within the contractor's organization;

      (vii) The existence of training institutions capable of training persons in the requisite skills; and

      (viii) The degree of training which the contractor is reasonably able to undertake as a means of making all job classes available to minorities or females.

   (3) In the event the Division's analysis reveals underutilization of minorities or women it shall:

      (i) request an explanation of the apparent underutilization; and

      (ii) consider the anticipated expansion, contraction and turnover in the workforce before developing with the contractor an Employment Program or determining if it has reasonable cause to believe that the contractor is not in compliance with E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations.

   (4) The statistical criteria for evaluating the composition of the contractor's workforce will be the following:

      (i) the term "underutilization" means a statistically significant disparity between the employment of members of a racial, ethnic, or sexual group and their availability as determined by the Division's utilization analysis; and

      (ii) the term "utilization analysis" will mean an analysis of the contractor's workforce using standard statistical techniques to test a null hypothesis that utilization of a given protected group is within acceptable limits, given its availability. For the purpose of these regulations, the null hypothesis will be rejected (i.e., underutilization will be assumed) whenever there is reason to believe that the utilization rate is below the availability rate at the 80 percent level of significance.

(c) Analysis of policies and practices – identification of problem areas. The Division shall analyze the following policies, practices and procedures of the contractor to insure that individuals are not discriminated against on the basis of their race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, handicap, marital status, sexual orientation or citizenship status:

   (1) The composition of applicant flow;

   (2) The total selection process including position descriptions, position titles, worker specifications, application forms, interview procedures, pre-employment physical exams, inquiries with respect to disabilities, test administration, test validity, referral procedures, final selection process and similar factors;

   (3) Transfer and promotion practices;

   (5) Facilities including architectural and other barriers to the employment of handicapped persons, company sponsored recreation and social events, and special programs such as educational assistance;

   (6) Seniority practices and seniority provisions of union contracts;

   (7) Apprenticeship programs;

   (8) All company training programs, formal and informal;

   (9) Working atmosphere; and

   (10) Technical phases of compliance, such as notification to labor unions, retention of applications, notification to subcontractors, etc.

(d) Special provisions concerning compliance. 

   (1) A contractor shall not be in violation of E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations if the contractor hires, employs, trains employees or otherwise discriminates on the basis of employees' creed, sex or national origin in those certain instances where creed, sex or national origin is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the contractor's business. The contractor shall have the burden of demonstrating that it has complied with the requirements of this paragraph.

   (2) A contractor shall not be in violation of E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations with respect to age discrimination where it terminates the employment of any person who is physically unable to perform his or her duties or acts pursuant to a retirement policy or system where such policy or system is not merely a subterfuge to evade the purposes of E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations. The contractor shall have the burden of demonstrating that it has complied with the requirements of this paragraph.

   (3) Neither the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement, nor the failure by a union with whom the contractor has a collective bargaining agreement, to refer employees without regard to their race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, handicap, marital status, sexual orientation or citizenship status shall excuse the contractor's obligations under E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations.

   (4) A contractor shall not be in violation of E.O. 50 (66 RCNY § 10-14) and these regulations if it applies different standards of compensation or different terms, conditions or privileges of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority system.

(e) Establishment of an employment program. If any of the following items are found by the Division in its analysis and the contractor fails to demonstrate that the item does not have a discriminatory effect, an Employment Program may be developed by the Division and the contractor containing special corrective action:

   (1) Underutilization of minorities or women in specific job groups;

   (2) Lateral or vertical movement of minority, female, handicapped or older employees occurring at a proportionately lesser rate than that of other employees;

   (3) Selection procedures which eliminate a significantly higher percentage of minorities, women, handicapped or older employees as compared to other employees;

   (4) Application and related pre-employment forms which do not comply with applicable equal employment standards;

   (5) Disparity in the wages, salaries, fringe benefits and other forms of compensation paid to minorities, women, handicapped or older employees as compared to other employees;

   (6) Position descriptions which are inaccurate in relation to actual functions and duties performed;

   (7) Formal or scored selection procedures not validated as required by applicable equal employment standards;

*§ 11-03 Certification of LBE's.*


(a) Application for certification. 

   (1) A contractor or subcontractor seeking certification as an LBE is responsible for submission of true and accurate certification documents demonstrating that it meets all eligibility criteria. Falsification of any documents submitted in connection with the LBE program may lead to the imposition of civil and criminal penalties as provided by law and contract and disqualification from the LBE program.

   (2) A contractor or subcontractor seeking certification as an LBE when no contract is pending shall submit its certification documents directly to the Division.

   (3) A contractor seeking certification as an LBE when bidding on a particular contract shall submit its certification documents to the contracting agency with its bid.

   (4) A subcontractor which has been proposed as an LBE subcontractor by a contractor bidding on a contract but has not been certified as an LBE shall have its certification documents submitted by the bidder in the sealed envelope to the contracting agency within 10 days after notification of low bid.

   (5) A subcontractor which has been proposed as an LBE subcontractor by a contractor subsequent to contract award but has not been certified as an LBE shall have its certification documents submitted by the contractor in a sealed envelope to the contracting agency within 10 business days from the date that the proposed LBE subcontractor is identified.

   (6) The contracting agency shall immediately transmit certification documents it receives to OEFO.

   (7) A contractor or subcontractor shall submit such additional information as may be required by OEFO in connection with its certifications as an LBE. Failure to submit such information within 10 business days of the date of a written request may result in the denial or revocation of certification as an LBE.

   (8) Consistent with the requirements of Federal, State and City law, neither OEFO nor any contracting agency shall disclose to unauthorized persons confidential business information submitted by contractors and subcontractors.

(b) Eligibility requirements. 

   (1) A contractor or subcontractor shall be certified as an LBE upon a determination by OEFO that it has met the eligibility requirements set forth in the Administrative Code, § 6-108.1 and these regulations. The initial certification shall be effective for three years and shall expire at the end of such period, except as provided in 66 RCNY § 11-03(b)(2) and (b)(9). An LBE may apply to have certification renewed after this three year period, as set forth in 66 RCNY § 11-03(b)(4).

   (2) A business which has been in existence for less than one year prior to the date of application for certification and which would otherwise qualify as an LBE except that it does not meet the criteria set forth in 66 RCNY § 11-02 "Locally based enterprise" (2), may nevertheless be certified as an LBE, provided that such certification shall expire one year after it is granted unless the business meets the criteria set forth in such paragraph within one year of the date of its certification.

   (3) An LBE seeking continuance of certification granted according to subdivision (b)(2) of this section must submit certification documents before two months prior to the one year anniversary of such certification. If after this one year period, the business meets all the criteria for LBE eligibility as set forth in 66 RCNY § 11-02 "Locally based enterprise," certification shall be granted for two more years. This business may apply to have certification renewed after this two year period as set forth in 66 RCNY § 11-03(b)(4).

   (4) An LBE may seek to have its certification renewed for successive one year periods by submitting certification documents before two months prior to the expiration date of its certification demonstrating that it continues to meet the eligibility requirements set forth in Administrative Code, § 6-108.1 and these regulations.

   (5) Failure to submit certification documents before two months prior to the applicable certification anniversary date, as set forth in 66 RCNY § 11-03(b)(3) or (b)(4), may result in the expiration of the LBE certification on the anniversary date.

   (6) If the certification of an LBE expires or if the LBE is determined to be ineligible for re-certification, the LBE may submit another set of certification documents six months after the date its original certification expired or six months after the date it was determined to be ineligible for re-certification.

   (7) If an LBE submits certification documents before two months prior to the applicable certification anniversary date, as set forth in 66 RCNY § 11-03(b)(3) or (b)(4), and the Division is unable to make a determination before the anniversary date, the LBE will be notified that certification will continue until the Division makes a determination as to the LBE's status. If an LBE submits certification documents within the second month prior to the anniversary date, the Division may not be able to review the documents to determine their completeness and the LBE's certification will expire. If the Division is able to review the documents, it may notify the LBE that its certification will continue beyond the anniversary date. If an LBE submits certification documents within the month prior to the anniversary date, its certification will expire on the anniversary date unless it is re-certified.

   (8) A business which was certified as an LBE prior to the effective date of these regulations shall be deemed to have been certified as an LBE on the date of such certification, provided however that any business which was less than one year old at the time of such certification and did not meet all the criteria of eligibility set forth in 66 RCNY § 11-03 "Locally based enterprise" of these regulations, shall be deemed to have been certified according to 66 RCNY § 11-03(b)(2) and such certification shall expire on the one year anniversary of the certification date. Such business may seek continuance of its certification as provided in 66 RCNY § 11-03(b)(3).

   (9) Any LBE which has been certified prior to the effective date of these regulations, for a period longer than specified in 66 RCNY § 11-03(b)(1) and (b)(2), must submit certification documents within two months after the effective date of these regulations, unless re-certification has been granted prior to the effective date of these regulations.

   (10) It is the intent of these regulations to qualify businesses as LBEs only if the ownership, management and operations of the business are conducted by persons who do not own, manage or operate other similar businesses which would otherwise be ineligible. Any business applying for LBE certification that does not conform to this intent shall be deemed ineligible as an LBE.

   (11) An LBE must be an independent business. A business that is a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes shall not necessarily be deemed to be an independent business. In determining whether a business is an independent business, the Division shall consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to the date the business was established, the identity of the principals, the sources of financing and the major shareholders, if any, of the business.

   (12) The owner of an LBE must possess the ability to manage the business and to make necessary management and policy decisions. The business must not be subject to any extraordinary formal or informal restrictions which limit the discretion of the owners.

   (13) The following types of ownership, control, or circumstances concerning a business seeking certification as an LBE shall render it ineligible for participation in the program:

      (i) ownership of the business by a non-LBE construction business;

      (ii) whole or partial ownership of the business by a person who is an owner in whole or in part of another construction business when the sum of the gross receipts of these businesses exceeds the limits as provided for in 66 RCNY § 11-22 "Locally based enterprise";

      (iii) whole or partial ownership of a business, formed within three years of application, by a person who is an owner in whole or in part of another construction business not eligible for the program;

      (iv) control of the business by another construction business through substantial funding arrangements or;

      (v) organization of a firm in existence for less than one year whose officers, directors, principal stockholders, or employees serve as the officers, directors, principal stockholders, or employees, of another construction business and one concern is furnishing, or will furnish the other concern with subcontracts, financial or technical assistance, or other facilities, whether for a fee or otherwise.

   (14) If, after submitting certification documents, a business is found to not meet the requirements for LBE certification as set forth in 66 RCNY § 11-02 "Locally based enterprise" is otherwise ineligible, it may submit other certification documents for certification six months after the date it was declared ineligible.

   (15) A joint venture consisting of an LBE and a non-LBE business may participate in the LBE program as a contractor or subcontractor if both joint venturers' contract work is defined clearly. However, only the LBE's share of the contract work shall be credited towards the LBE goal.

   (16) An LBE shall notify the Division within 30 days after any change in its ownership or control. In addition, each LBE shall submit a report to the Division by December 30 of each year describing its present ownership and control. The Division shall review any changes made since an LBE's certification to determine whether it remains eligible as an LBE.

   (17) A business certified prior to the effective date of these regulations, whose ownership or control has changed shall notify the Division within 30 days of the effective date of these regulations of such change.

   (18) Newly formed businesses and businesses whose ownership or control has changed since the date of issuance of these regulations shall be scrutinized by the Division to determine the reasons for the formation, change in the ownership or control of the business.

   (19) Once a business is certified as an LBE, it must satisfactorily complete any contracts it is awarded. If an LBE does not satisfactorily complete a contract, it will be required to participate in and successfully complete a technical assistance program through the Department. If the LBE fails to successfully complete or does not participate in the technical assistance program it will be de-certified as an LBE. An LBE will be given an opportunity to respond to any allegations that it has not performed satisfactorily on a contract or that it has not successfully completed or participated in the technical assistance program pursuant to the procedure in 66 RCNY § 11-03(c)(8). If an LBE is de-certified, such business may re-apply for certification after six months from the date of de-certification. It must demonstrate at that time that it has improved its work performance.

(c) Certification responsibilities of the Division. 

   (1) Division shall have the power to certify, re-certify and de-certify a contractor or a subcontractor as an LBE upon a determination that the contractor or subcontractor has met or failed to meet the eligibility requirements and conditions set forth in Administrative Code § 6-108.1 and these regulations.

   (2) The determination by the Division as to a contractor's or subcontractor's eligibility for certification as an LBE shall be final.

The contractor shall have 10 business days from the date of the telephone call or from the date of the letter to complete the certification documents. If the contractor fails to submit the additional information within the time allowed, the contractor shall be so notified by the Division by letter on the next business day following the 10 day response period. Copies of this notification letter shall be sent to the prime contractor and the agency.

   (6) If complete certification documents have been submitted by a proposed LBE subcontractor for a particular contract waiting award, the Division within one business day after determining that the documents are complete, shall notify the contracting agency that the contract may be awarded.

   (7) The Division shall notify the proposed LBE contractor (and the prime contractor and the contracting agency where applicable) of its certification determination within 15 business days of the receipt of complete certification documents.

   (8) If the Division has reason to believe that an LBE is in violation of Administrative Code § 6-108.1 or these regulations, the Division shall provide notice to the LBE by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the alleged violation. Within twenty-five calendar days of the receipt of such notice the LBE may respond to the allegation in writing or request an opportunity to appear before the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee to respond to the allegation. The Commissioner or the designee, after considering the evidence of the alleged violation and any material submitted by the LBE, shall determine whether the LBE shall be de-certified. The Commissioner or the designee may determine that a contractor or subcontractor who has been de-certified shall be ineligible for certification for a period of up to three years after such de-certification.

   (9) If at any time the Division has reason to believe that a contractor or subcontractor has willfully and knowingly provided incorrect information or made false statements, it shall refer the matter to its Inspector General for investigation. The Inspector General shall investigate the matter in accordance with applicable rules and procedures, and, where appropriate, refer or report the matter to the Department of Investigation. Falsification of any document by a contractor or subcontractor may lead to the imposition of civil and criminal penalties as provided by law and contract, disqualification from the LBE program and debarment from City contracts.

   (10) The Division shall conduct audits of LBEs to verify information provided by them.

   (11) The Division shall determine the effectiveness of Administrative Code § 6-108.1 by conducting surveys or other studies it deems appropriate.

      (ii) The following documents shall be attached to the "LBE Participation Schedule":

         (A) verification letters from each subcontractor listed in the "LBE Participation Schedule" stating that the LBE will enter into a formal agreement for work,

         (B) certification documents of any proposed LBE subcontractor which is not on the LBE certified lists, and

         (C) copies of the certification letter of any proposed subcontractor which is an LBE.

      (iii) Documentation of good faith efforts to achieve the required LBE percentage shall include but not be limited to the following:

         (A) attendance at pre-bid meetings, when scheduled by the agency, to advise bidders of contract requirements;

         (B) advertisement where appropriate in general circulation media, trade association publications, and small business media for specific subcontracts that would be at least equal to the percentage goal for LBE utilization specified by the contractor;

         (C) notification to small, minority and woman contractor associations in writing, for solicitation of specific subcontracts;

         (D) written notification by certified mail to LBE firms that their interest in the contract is solicited;

         (E) demonstration of efforts made to select portions of the work proposed to be performed by LBE firms in order to increase the likelihood of achieving the stated goals;

         (F) documented efforts to negotiate with LBE firms for specific subcontracts including at a minimum: (a) The names, addresses and telephone numbers of LBE firms that were contacted; (b) A description of the information provided to LBE firms regarding the plans and specifications for portions of the work to be performed; (c) Documentation that no reasonable price can be obtained from LBE firms; (d) A statement of why agreements with LBE firms were not reached;

         (G) a statement of the reason for rejecting any LBE firm which the contractor deemed to be unqualified; and

         (H) documentation of efforts made to assist the LBE firms contacted that needed assistance in obtaining required insurance.

   (5) Failure of the apparent low bidder to provide the information required in 66 RCNY § 11-04(g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section within the allotted time may render the bid non-responsive and the contract may not be awarded to the bidder, except: If the contractor states that it will subcontract a specific portion of the work, but can demonstrate that despite good faith efforts it cannot achieve its required LBE percentage for subcontracted work until after award of contract, the contract may be awarded subject to a letter of compliance from the contractor stating that it will comply with Administrative Code § 6-108.1 and subject to approval by the agency head.

   (6) If the contractor has not met its required LBE percentage prior to award, the contractor shall demonstrate that a good faith effort has been made subsequent to award to obtain LBEs on each subcontract until it meets the required percentage.

   (7) If a contractor submits certification documents for a subcontractor it wishes to use towards its LBE required percentage, the contracting agency may not award the contract until the Division has notified it that such certification documents are complete. After the Division has notified the agency that the proposed subcontractor's certification documents are complete, the contract may be awarded. However, no firm may be counted toward the contractor's LBE obligation unless it has been certified as an LBE. The Division shall notify the prime contractor that the certification documents of its proposed subcontractor are complete and that its certification is pending and is subject to review. It shall inform the prime contractor that if the proposed subcontractor is denied certification, the prime contractor must propose another LBE.

   (8) If a contractor states prior to award that it will not subcontract work under the contract, the contractor may not subcontract any work without prior approval by the contracting agency. Such a contractor shall notify the agency at least six weeks prior to the start of work by any subcontractor that subcontracting is proposed. During such six-week period the contractor shall seek LBEs to do the work. No subcontracting by such a contractor shall be approved unless the required percentage of subcontracting work is awarded to an LBE, or unless the agency grants a waiver from such requirement upon a finding that a good faith effort has been made to find an LBE.

   (9) The contractor may not substitute or change any LBE which was identified prior to award of the contract without the permission of the agency head. The contractor shall make a written application to the contracting agency head for permission to make such substitution or change, explaining why the contractor needs to change its LBE subcontractor and how the contractor will meet its LBE subcontracting requirement. Copies of such application must be served on the originally identified LBE by certified mail return receipt requested as well as the proposed substitute LBE. The agency head shall determine whether or not to grant the contractor's request for substitution.

   (10) If the contractor contends that the LBE requirement cannot be met either before or after contract award and can demonstrate a good faith effort to obtain an LBE, a waiver may be granted by the agency head upon approval by the Division.

(h) Subcontractor waivers. 

   (1) Subject to approval by the Division, an agency head may waive the subcontracting requirements of Administrative Code § 6-108.1 and these regulations upon a finding that:

      (i) there is no identifiable LBE subcontractor reasonably available, willing and qualified to perform subcontracted work, provided that

         (A) the contractor has been unable to identify an LBE subcontractor after good faith efforts as set forth in 66 RCNY § 11-04(g)(4)(iii) and

         (B) the contracting agency has been unable to locate an LBE after a search of the LBE list; or

      (ii) the contract involves an emergency requiring immediate attention because the public health, safety, or welfare is threatened; or

      (iii) for other good cause. Such finding shall be made in writing, state the reasons therefore, and be submitted to the Division if a waiver is requested.

   (2) The Division may direct an agency head to submit further evidence concerning the necessity for a waiver.

   (3) Upon the approval of an agency head's waiver decision, the Division shall send written notification of such waiver to the Vice Chairman of the City Council.

(i) Verification of contractor compliance. The contracting agency shall perform the following procedures with regard to auditing contractor compliance:

   (1) The LBE liaison officer described in 66 RCNY § 11-04(d)(2) shall distribute to the resident engineer a list of LBE subcontractors that have been identified by the prime contractor for use on the project. The resident engineer shall notify the LBE liaison officer of all subcontractors working on the site.

   (2) As the work progresses, the LBE liaison officer shall periodically telephone all LBEs identified by the prime contractor to verify that they are on the site and performing specified LBE work.

   (3) Each contracting agency shall conduct on-site reviews of the contractor's compliance with the LBE requirements. Such review may include interviews, visits to the actual construction site, and an inspection of any records relevant to the contractor's performance.

   (4) The contractor shall cooperate fully with these reviews. Failure or refusal to furnish information or to cooperate may be deemed a breach of contract and a violation of these regulations which may result in the imposition of sanctions as provided in 66 RCNY § 11-04(j).

   (5) The LBE liaison officer shall audit contractor payments to LBE subcontractors by obtaining payment compliance reports every month from both the contractor and the LBE subcontractor. The agency shall investigate all significant report variances.

   (6) The LBE liaison officer shall review total payments of prime contractors to LBE subcontractors to insure that the amount equals the LBE percentage required by the contract. If the sum of LBE subcontractor payments is less than the required amount, the contractor may be found in breach of contract and sanctions may be applied in an amount commensurate with the magnitude of noncompliance.

   (7) The LBE liaison officer shall maintain an LBE file for each project whether or not it is subject to LBE requirements. When the contracting agency determines that the program does not apply to a project or any part of it, the reasons for that decision shall be placed in the file.

   (8) After review of the contractor's performance, the contracting agency shall make one of the following determinations with respect to the contractor's compliance with the LBE requirements:

      (i) the contractor is in compliance; or

      (ii) there is reasonable cause to believe that the contractor is in noncompliance.

   (9) Whenever a contracting agency has reasonable cause to believe that a contractor is in noncompliance, it shall send a notice promptly by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the contractor describing the noncompliance and requiring the contractor to show cause within five days why it should not be found in noncompliance. If the agency determines that there is noncompliance, it shall offer the contractor a 15-day period from the date of notification of the determination an opportunity to conciliate.

      (i) If conciliation is successful, a conciliation agreement shall be signed by the agency and the contractor and filed with the Division.

      (ii) If conciliation is not successful, the agency shall determine whether sanctions should be imposed.

   (10) The contracting agency shall notify the Division of any determination of noncompliance and the imposition of any sanctions. The Division shall notify all other contracting agencies of the determination and the sanctions imposed.

(j) Sanctions. 

   (1) When a contracting agency determines that a prime contractor has failed to comply with the requirements of Administrative Code § 6-108.1 or these regulations, the agency may impose any or all of the following sanctions:

      (i) Reducing of a contractor's compensation by an amount equal to the dollar value of the LBE required percentage not complied with;

      (ii) Declaring the contractor in default.

   (2) In addition, where the prime contractor is an LBE, the agency shall refer the matter to the Division for further action including the review of the LBE's continued eligibility for certification.

(e) Upon completion of the investigation, the complaining party and the contractor or subcontractor involved shall be informed of the results of the investigation in writing.

(f) No contractor, subcontractor, or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual or business for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Administrative Code § 6-108.1 and these regulations or because a complaint was filed, or a person testified, assisted or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under these regulations.

(g) The identity of the complaining party shall be kept confidential only on request. If such confidentiality hinders the investigation, the complaining party shall be so advised for the purpose of obtaining a waiver of confidentiality.

(i) A certification application may be withdrawn by an applicant without prejudice at any time prior to an audit. Following the withdrawal of a certification application, the applicant may not reapply for certification for a period of at least one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of withdrawal of the application.

   (2) (a) The division and the city chief procurement officer will develop a citywide utilization plan for the procurements of goods.

      (b) Agencies will develop agency utilization plans pursuant to 66 RCNY § 11-64. The citywide goals will not be summarily adopted as goals for all annual agency utilization plans; rather, goals for such plans may be set at levels higher, lower, or the same as the citywide goals, subject to the approval of the commissioner as described in paragraph three of 66 RCNY § 11-64. When setting its goals, each agency must consider the citywide goals, the size and nature of its own procurement portfolio, and the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs with the capacity to perform the specific types and scale of work for which the agency anticipates it will solicit procurements during the year. Agencies will seek to ensure substantial progress toward the attainment of these goals in as short a time as practicable.

   (3) The citywide goals will not be summarily adopted as goals for individual procurements; rather, as set forth in 66 RCNY § 11-66, goals for such procurements may be set at levels higher, lower, or the same as the citywide goals. In setting such goals, each agency must take into account the citywide goals and the agency's annual utilization plan, the size and nature of the procurement, and the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs with the capacity to perform the specific types and scale of work involved in its procurements.

   (4) (a) No later than 2015, the commissioner, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, will, for each industry classification and each minority group, review and compare the availability rates of firms owned by minorities and women to the utilization rates of such firms in agency contracts and direct subcontracts, and will on the basis of such review and any other relevant information, where appropriate, revise by rule the citywide participation goals set forth in this section. In making such revision, the commissioner will consider the extent to which discrimination continues to have an impact on the ability of minorities and women to compete for city contracts and subcontracts. The commissioner will submit the results of such review and any proposed revisions to the participation goals to the speaker of the council at least sixty days prior to publishing a proposed rule that would revise participation goals. Such review will thereafter be conducted at least once every two years.

      (b) No later than 2015, the commissioner will review information collected by the department to determine the availability and utilization of EBEs, and will on the basis of such review and any other relevant information, where appropriate, revise by rule the citywide participation goals set forth in this section. Such revised goals will be set at a level intended to assist in overcoming the impact of discrimination on such businesses. Such review will be conducted in 2015 and at least once every two years thereafter.

All solicitations for contracts for which contractor utilization plans are to be established will include notice of potential audit.

(11) The division will assist agencies in identifying and seeking ways to reduce or eliminate practices such as bonding requirements or delays in payment by prime contractors that may present barriers to competition by MBEs, WBEs and EBEs.

(12) The division will encourage prime contractors to enter joint venture agreements with MBEs, WBEs and EBEs.

(13) The division will assist appropriate certified business enterprises in becoming prequalified for those categories of procurement for which they may be eligible and for which contracting agencies utilize prequalification in the procurement process;

   (b) At any time more than two years after the division has determined that a firm qualifies as a graduate MBE, WBE or EBE, the firm may apply to have such designation lifted. The division will lift the designation if the firm demonstrates that it has not been awarded contracts by one or more agencies within the past three years where the total city funding from the expense and capital budgets for such contracts was equal to or greater than fifty million dollars and it has been below the size standards established by the United States small business administration for its industry for a period of two years or more.






*§ 11-63 Responsibilities of Agency M/WBE Officers.*


Each agency head will designate a deputy commissioner or other executive officer to act as the agency M/WBE officer who will be directly accountable to the agency head concerning the activities of the agency in carrying out its responsibilities pursuant to this section, including the responsibilities relating to EBE participation. The duties of the M/WBE officer will include, but not be limited to:

(1) creating the agency's utilization plan in accordance with 66 RCNY § 11-64;

(2) acting as the agency's liaison with the division;

(3) acting as a liaison with organizations and/or associations of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs, informing such organizations and/or associations of the agency's procurement procedures, and advising them of future procurement opportunities;

(5) referring MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to technical assistance services available from agencies and other organizations;

(6) reviewing requests for waivers and/or modifications of participation goals and contractor utilization plans in accordance with 66 RCNY § 11-66;

(7) working with the division and city chief procurement officer in creating directories of certified MBEs, WBEs and EBEs pursuant to 66 RCNY § 11-68. In fulfilling this duty, the agency M/WBE officer will track and record each contractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE and each subcontractor hired pursuant to such officer's agency contracts that is an MBE, WBE or EBE, and will share such information with the director, the commissioner, and the city chief procurement officer;

(8) for contracts for which contractor utilization plans have been established pursuant to 66 RCNY § 11-66, monitoring each contractor's compliance with its utilization plan by appropriate means, which will include, but need not be limited to, job site inspections, contacting MBEs, WBEs and EBEs identified in the plan to confirm their participation, and auditing the contractor's books and records;

(9) monitoring the agency's procurement activities to ensure compliance with its agency utilization plan and progress towards the participation goals as established in such plan;

(10) providing to the city chief procurement officer information for the reports required in 66 RCNY § 11-69 and providing any other plans and/or reports required pursuant to this subchapter or requested by the director and/or the city chief procurement officer; and

(11) participating in meetings required pursuant to 66 RCNY § 11-70.






*§ 11-64 Agency Utilization Plans.*


(1) Beginning May 15, 2006, and on April 1 of each year thereafter, each agency which, during the fiscal year which ended on June 30 of the preceding year, has made procurements in excess of five million dollars, without counting procurements exempt pursuant to paragraph two of 66 RCNY § 11-74, must submit an agency utilization plan for the fiscal year commencing in July of the year when such plan is to be submitted to the commissioner. Upon approval by the commissioner such plan will be submitted to the speaker of the council. Each such plan will, at a minimum, include the following:

   (a) the agency's participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and EBEs for the year, provided however, that when setting its goals, each agency must consider the citywide goals, the size and nature of its own procurement portfolio (excluding contracts described in paragraph two of 66 RCNY § 11-74), and the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs with the capacity to perform the specific types and scale of work for which the agency anticipates it will solicit procurements during the year;

   (b) an explanation for any agency goal that is different than the participation goal for the relevant group and industry classification as determined pursuant to 66 RCNY § 11-61;

   (c) a list of the names and titles of agency personnel responsible for implementation of the agency utilization plan;

   (d) methods and relevant activities proposed for achieving the agency's participation goals; and

   (e) any other information which the agency or the commissioner deems relevant or necessary.

(2) An agency utilization plan must set forth specific participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs for purchases of professional services, standard services, construction and goods valued at or below twenty thousand dollars, and for purchases of professional services, standard services, construction and goods valued at or below one hundred thousand dollars. When setting its goals for such purchases, in addition to the factors set forth in paragraph (1) of this section, each agency must specifically consider the potential for such purchases to provide opportunities for MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to develop greater capacity, thereby increasing competition for city procurements.

(3) An agency utilization plan may be amended from time to time to reflect changes in the agency's projected expenditures or other relevant circumstances and resulting changes in such agency's participation goals. Such amendments must be submitted to the commissioner, the city chief procurement officer and the speaker of the council at least thirty days prior to implementation.

(4) In planning its procurement activities over the course of the fiscal year, each agency subject to this section must consider how it will achieve the goals set forth in its approved agency utilization plan. This determination should be guided by the agency's knowledge of the market involved in the procurement, and the level of progress it has made during the fiscal year toward meeting its goal for the relevant category of procurement.

(5) Prior to approving individual agency utilization plans, the commissioner, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, will consider whether such plans viewed in the aggregate establish any goals exceeding the corresponding citywide goals set forth in 66 RCNY § 11-61. If the commissioner, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, finds any aggregated goals exceed the corresponding citywide goal, the commissioner will require agencies to adjust their goals so that plans, viewed in the aggregate, do not establish goals exceeding the citywide goals. Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to limit the award of contracts and subcontracts that may be made to MBEs, WBEs and EBEs without using goals.

(6) The commissioner, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, will, no later than July 31 of each year, publish on the division's website a plan and schedule for each agency detailing the anticipated contracting actions for the upcoming fiscal year that form the basis for the agency utilization plan of each such agency. The plan and schedule will include information specific to each prospective invitation for bids, request for proposal, or other solicitation, including, but not limited to, the specific type and scale of the services and/or goods to be procured, the term of the proposed contract, the method of solicitation the agency intends to utilize, and the anticipated fiscal year quarter of the planned solicitation.






*§ 11-65 Achieving Agency Participation Goals.*


(1) Each agency head must be directly accountable for the goals set forth in his or her agency's utilization plan.

(2) Each agency must make all reasonable efforts to meet the participation goals established in its agency utilization plan. Agencies will, at a minimum, use the following methods to achieve participation goals:

   (a) Agencies must engage in outreach activities to encourage MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to compete for all facets of their procurement activities, including contracts awarded by negotiated acquisition, emergency and sole source contracts, and each agency will seek to utilize MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs for all types of goods, services and construction they procure.

   (b) Agencies must encourage eligible businesses to apply for certification as MBEs, WBEs and EBEs and inclusion in the directories of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs. Agencies must also encourage MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to have their names included on their bidders lists, seek pre-qualification where applicable, and compete for city business as contractors and subcontractors. Agencies are encouraged to advertise procurement opportunities in general circulation media, trade and professional association publications and small business media, and publications of minority and women's business organizations, and send written notice of specific procurement opportunities to minority and women's business organizations.

   (c) All agency solicitations for bids or proposals must include information referring potential bidders or proposers to the directories of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs prepared by the division.

   (d) In planning procurements, agencies must consider the effect of the scope, specifications and size of a contract on opportunities for participation by MBEs, WBEs and EBEs.

   (e) Prior to soliciting bids or proposals for contracts valued at over ten million dollars, other than contracts for capital projects valued at over twenty-five million dollars and contracts that are exempt pursuant to paragraph two of 66 RCNY § 11-74, an agency must submit the bid or proposal to the city chief procurement officer for a determination whether it is practicable to divide the proposed contract into smaller contracts and whether doing so will enhance competition for such contracts among MBEs, WBEs and EBEs and other potential bidders or proposers. The agency must follow the instructions of the city chief procurement officer in cases where he or she determines that it is both practicable and advantageous in light of cost and other relevant factors to divide such contracts into smaller contracts.

   (f) Agencies must examine their internal procurement policies, procedures and practices and, where practicable, address those elements, if any, that may negatively affect participation of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in city procurement.






*§ 11-66 Participation Goals for Contracts for Construction and Professional and Standard Services.*


(1) Prior to issuing the solicitation of bids or proposals for individual contracts, agencies must establish participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs. Such goals may be greater than, less than or the same as the relevant citywide goal or goals established pursuant to 66 RCNY § 11-61. Taking into account the factors listed in this subdivision, an agency may establish a goal for a procurement that may be achieved by a combination of prime contract and subcontract dollars, a combination of construction and services performed pursuant to the contract, and/or a combination of MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs. Alternatively, an agency may establish specific goals for particular types of services, and/or goals for particular types of certified firms. In determining the participation goals for a particular contract, an agency must consider the following factors:

   (a) the scope of work;

   (b) the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs able to perform the particular tasks required in the contract;

   (c) the extent to which the type and scale of work involved in the contract present prime contracting and subcontracting opportunities for amounts within the capacity of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs;

   (d) the agency's progress to date toward meeting its annual participation goals through race-neutral, gender-neutral and other means, and the agency's expectations as to the effect such methods will have on participation of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in the agency's future contracts; and

   (e) any other factors the contracting agency deems relevant.

(2) A contracting agency shall not be required to establish participation goals (i) for procurements described in 66 RCNY § 11-74; or (ii) when the agency has already attained the relevant goal in its annual utilization plan, or expects that it will attain such goal without the use of such participation goals.

(3) For each contract in which a contracting agency has established participation goals, such agency shall state in the solicitation for such contract that bidders and/or proposers shall be required to agree as a material term of the contract that the contractor must meet the participation goals unless such goals are waived or modified by the agency in accordance with this section. An agency must permit a contractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE to count its own participation toward fulfillment of the relevant participation goal, provided that the agency has determined the value of such a contractor's participation by subtracting from the total value of the contract any amounts that the contractor pays to direct subcontractors. An agency must permit a contractor that is a qualified joint venture to count a percentage of its own participation toward fulfillment of the relevant participation goal. The agency must determine the value of such a contractor's participation by subtracting from the total value of the contract any amounts that the contractor pays to direct subcontractors, and then multiplying the remainder by the percentage to be applied to total profit to determine the amount to which an MBE, WBE or EBE is entitled pursuant to the joint venture agreement. Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, a contractor's achievement of participation goals must be determined as described in paragraph two of 66 RCNY § 11-67.

(4) For each contract in which participation goals are established, the agency must include in its solicitation and/or bidding materials, a referral to the directories prepared by the division pursuant to 66 RCNY § 11-62.

(5) For each contract for which participation goals are established the contractor must submit with its bid or proposal a utilization plan indicating:

   (a) whether the contractor is an MBE, WBE, EBE, or a qualified joint venture;

   (b) the percentage of work it intends to award to direct subcontractors; and

   (c) in cases where the contractor intends to award direct subcontracts, a description of the type and dollar value of work designated for participation by MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs, and the time frames in which such work is scheduled to begin and end. When the contractor utilization plan indicates that the bidder or proposer does not intend to meet the participation goals, the bid or proposal will not be deemed responsive unless the agency has granted a pre-award request for change pursuant to subdivision 11 of this section.

(6) (a) For each contract for which a contractor utilization plan has been submitted, the contracting agency must require that within thirty days of the issuance of notice to proceed, and at least once per year thereafter, the contractor submit a list of persons to which it intends to award subcontracts within the next twelve months, and a written confirmation that the contractor has notified each MBE, WBE or EBE included in such list. For multi-year contracts, the contractor must submit such a list of persons and written confirmation of notification to the agency annually. In the event that a contracting agency disapproves a contractor's selection of a subcontractor or subcontractors, the contracting agency must allow such contractor a reasonable time to propose alternate subcontractors.

   (b) The contracting agency may also require the contractor to report periodically about the contracts awarded by its direct subcontractors to indirect subcontractors.

(7) For each contract for which a contractor utilization plan has been submitted, the contractor must, with each voucher for payment, and/or periodically as the agency may require, submit statements, certified under penalty of perjury, which must include, but not be limited to, the total amount the contractor paid to its direct subcontractors, and, where applicable pursuant to subparagraph (l) of paragraph (1) of 66 RCNY § 11-67, the total amount direct subcontractors paid to indirect subcontractors, the names, addresses and contact numbers of each MBE, WBE or EBE hired as a subcontractor by the contractor or any of the contractor's direct subcontractors, as well as the dates and amounts paid to each MBE, WBEs or EBEs. The contractor must also submit, along with its voucher for final payment, the total amount it paid to subcontractors, and, where applicable pursuant to subparagraph (l) of paragraph (1) of 66 RCNY § 11-67, the total amount its direct subcontractors paid directly to their indirect subcontractors; and a final list, certified under penalty of perjury, which must include the name, address and contact information of each subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE, the work performed by, and the dates and amounts paid to each.

(8) If payments made to, or work performed by, MBEs, WBEs or EBEs are less than the amount specified in the contractor's utilization plan, the agency must take appropriate action in accordance with 66 RCNY § 11-72, unless the contractor has obtained a modification of its utilization plan pursuant to paragraph 12 of this section.

(9) When advertising a solicitation for bids or proposals for a contract for which a participation goal has been established, the agency must include in the advertisement a general statement that the contract will be subject to participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs.

(10) In the event that a contractor with a contract that includes a contractor utilization plan submits a request for a change order the value of which exceeds the greater of ten percent of such contract or $500,000, the agency must review the scope of work for the contract, and the scale and types of work involved in the change order, and determine whether the participation goals should be modified.

(11) Requests from bidders or proposers for changes in participation goals.

   (a) A bidder or proposer may request that an agency change the participation goal or goals established for the procurement on the grounds that goals are unreasonable in light of the availability of certified firms to perform the services required, or by demonstrating that it has legitimate business reasons for proposing a lower level of subcontracting in its utilization plan.

   (b) If the contracting agency determines that the participation goals established for the procurement are unreasonable in light of the availability of certified firms to perform the services required, it must revise the solicitation and extend the deadline for bids and proposals.

   (c) Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the contracting agency may grant a full or partial waiver of the participation goals to a bidder or proposer who demonstrates that it has legitimate business reasons for proposing the level of subcontracting in its utilization plan. The contracting agency will make its determination in light of factors that must include, but not be limited to, whether the bidder or proposer has the capacity and the bona fide intention to perform the contract without any subcontracting, or to perform the contract without awarding the amount of subcontracts represented by the participation goals. In making such determination, the agency may consider whether the utilization plan is consistent with past subcontracting practices of the bidder or proposer, whether the bidder or proposer has made efforts to form a joint venture with a certified firm, and whether the bidder or proposer has made good faith efforts to identify portions of the contract that it intends to subcontract. The city chief contracting officer will notify the council of any such waiver granted with respect to a registered contract in the quarterly report required pursuant to 66 RCNY § 11-69.

   (d) The agency M/WBE officer shall provide written notice of requests for a full or partial waiver of the participation goals to the division and the city chief procurement officer and will not approve any such request without the approval of the city chief procurement officer, provided that the city chief procurement officer, upon adequate assurances of an agency's ability to administer its utilization plan in accordance with the provisions of this section, may determine that further approval from the city chief procurement officer is not required with respect to such requests for an agency's contracts or particular categories of an agency's contracts. The city chief procurement officer will notify the speaker of the council and the division in writing in the quarterly report required pursuant to 66 RCNY § 11-69 following the registration of the contract for which the agency granted a request for a full or partial waiver of a participation goal, provided that where an agency has been authorized to grant waivers without approval of the chief procurement officer, such notice will be provided to the speaker of the council and the division by the agency. Such notification will include, but not be limited to, the name of the contractor, the original participation goal, the waiver request, including all documentation, and an explanation for the approval of such request.

(12) Modification of utilization plans at contractor's request or agency's initiative.

   (a) A contractor may request modification of its utilization plan after the award of a contract. Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, an agency may grant such request if it determines that such contractor has established, with appropriate documentary and other evidence, that it made all reasonable, good faith efforts to meet the goals set by the agency for the contract. In making such determination, the agency will consider evidence of the following efforts, as applicable, along with any other relevant factors:

      (i) The contractor advertised opportunities to participate in the contract, where appropriate, in general circulation media, trade and professional association publications and small business media, and publications of minority and women's business organizations;

      (ii) The contractor provided notice of specific opportunities to participate in the contract, in a timely manner, to minority and women's business organizations;

      (iii) The contractor sent written notices, by certified mail or facsimile, in a timely manner, to advise MBEs, WBEs and EBEs that their interest in the contract was solicited;

      (iv) The contractor made efforts to identify portions of the work that could be substituted for portions originally designated for participation by MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs in the contractor utilization plan, and for which the contractor claims an inability to retain MBEs or WBEs or EBEs;

      (v) The contractor held meetings with MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs prior to the date their bids or proposals were due, for the purpose of explaining in detail the scope and requirements of the work for which their bids or proposals were solicited. Documentation of such meetings must include the dates, times, and locations of such meetings, meeting announcements and invitations, meeting agendas, documents distributed at such meetings, and attendance lists;

      (vi) The contractor made efforts to negotiate with MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs as relevant to perform specific subcontracts, or act as suppliers or service providers. Documentation of such negotiation must include the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs that were solicited; the date of each such solicitation; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and evidence as to the reasons that agreements could not be reached with MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs to perform the work.

      (vii) Timely written requests for assistance made by the contractor to the agency M/WBE officer and to the division as well as documented requests for assistance made by the contractor to organizations that provide assistance in the recruitment and placement of MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs, including but not limited to, minority and/or women community organizations, minority and/or women contractors' groups; local, state and federal business assistance offices;

      (viii) Description of how recommendations made by the division and the contracting agency, and other organizations described in subparagraph (G) of this paragraph were acted upon and an explanation of why action upon such recommendations did not lead to the desired level of participation of MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs.

      (ix) The contractor rejected bids by MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs for sound reasons based upon a thorough investigation of their capabilities. The MBE's, WBE's and/or EBE's political or social affiliations or lack thereof will not be a legitimate reason for rejecting or not soliciting bids to meet the goals.

      (x) The contractor designated portions of the work to be performed by MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs in order to increase the likelihood that the goals will be met, including but not limited to, breaking out the work under the contract into feasible units to facilitate MBE, WBE and/or EBE participation.

      (xi) The contractor made efforts to assist interested MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as required by the City or the contractor.

      (xii) The contractor made efforts to assist interested MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies, materials, or related assistance or services.

   (b) The agency M/WBE officer must provide written notice of requests for such modifications to the division and the city chief procurement officer and will not approve any such request for modification without the approval of the city chief procurement officer, provided that the city chief procurement officer, upon adequate assurances of an agency's ability to administer its utilization plan in accordance with the provisions of this section, may determine that further approval from the city chief procurement officer is not required with respect to such requests for an agency's contracts or particular categories of an agency's contracts. The city chief procurement officer, will notify the speaker of the council and the division in writing within seven days of the approval of a request for modification of a utilization plan, provided that where an agency has been authorized to grant modifications without approval of the chief procurement officer, such notice will be provided to the speaker of the council and the division by the agency. Such notification must include, but not be limited to, the name of the contractor, the original utilization plan, the modification request, including all documentation, and an explanation for the approval of such request.

   (c) An agency may modify the participation goals established for a procurement when the agency has changed the scope of the work in a manner that affects the scale and types of work that the contractor indicated in its contractor utilization plan would be awarded to subcontractors.

   (d) The agency M/WBE officer will provide written notice to the contractor of its determination that must include the reasons for such determination.

(13) Substitution of the MBE, WBE and/or EBE subcontractor whose participation was necessary to achieve a participation goal will be permitted only with approval of the contracting agency, and only in the following circumstances:

   (a) Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed;

   (b) Poor performance;

   (c) Financial incapacity;

   (d) Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price or scope;

   (e) Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation where a reasonable price cannot be agreed;

   (f) Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing, or bonding requirements;

   (g) The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal;

   (h) Revocation of the subcontractor's certification as an MBE, WBE or EBE;

   (i) The contractor becomes aware of information negatively reflecting on the subcontractor's business integrity;

   (j) Other circumstances allowed by the agency after consultation with the division.

Where the contractor has established the basis for substitution to the satisfaction of the contract compliance officer, it must make good faith efforts to substitute with a subcontractor which can be counted toward achievement of the relevant goal. If the contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously disclosed in the compliance plan, the contractor must obtain approval of the agency M/WBE officer and must make good faith efforts to ensure that MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs have a reasonable opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.

(14) For each contract in which a contracting agency has established participation goals, the agency will evaluate and assess the contractor's performance in meeting each such goal. Such evaluation and assessment must be a part of the contractor's overall contract performance evaluation required pursuant to § 333 of the charter.






*§ 11-67 Determining Credit for MBE, WBE and EBE Participation.*


(1)  An agency's achievement of its annual goals will be calculated as follows:

   (a) The dollar amount that an agency has paid or is obligated to pay to a prime contractor which is an MBE, WBE or EBE, reduced by the dollar amount the contractor has paid or is obligated to pay its direct subcontractors upon their completion of work, will be credited toward the relevant goal. Where an agency has paid or is obligated to pay a prime contractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount will be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.

   (b) Except as provided in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph, the total dollar amount that a prime contractor of any agency has paid or is obligated to pay to a direct subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE will be credited toward the relevant goal. Where such a contractor has paid or is obligated to pay a direct subcontractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount will be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.

   (c) In the case of contracts of the types identified pursuant to subparagraph (l) of this paragraph, the total dollar amount that a prime contractor of an agency has paid or is obligated to pay a direct subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE, or EBE, reduced by the dollar amount the direct subcontractor has paid or is obligated to pay its indirect subcontractors upon completion of work, will be credited toward the relevant goal. Where such a contractor has paid or is obligated to pay a direct contractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount will be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.

   (d) In the case of contracts of the types identified pursuant to subparagraph (l) of this paragraph, the total dollar amount that a direct subcontractor of the prime contractor has paid or is obligated to pay to an indirect subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE will be credited toward the relevant goal. Where such a contractor has paid or is obligated to pay an indirect contractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount will be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.

   (e) For requirements contracts, credit will be given for the actual dollar amount paid under the contract.

   (f) Where one or more MBEs, WBEs or EBEs is participating in a qualified joint venture, the amounts that the joint venture is required to pay its direct subcontractors will be subtracted as provided in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, and then a percentage of the remaining dollar amount of the contract equal to the percentage of total profit to which MBEs, WBEs or EBEs are entitled pursuant to the joint venture agreement will be credited toward the relevant goal. Where such a participant in a joint venture is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount will be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.

   (g) No credit will be given for participation in a contract by an MBE, WBE or EBE that does not perform a commercially useful function.

   (h) No credit will be given for the participation in a contract by any company that has not been certified as an MBE, WBE or EBE in accordance with § 1304 of the charter.

   (i) In the case of a contract for which the contractor is paid on a commission basis, the dollar amount of the contract may be determined on the basis of the commission earned or reasonably anticipated to be earned under the contract.

   (j) No credit will be given to a contractor for participation in a contract by a graduate MBE, WBE or EBE.

   (k) The participation of a certified company will not be credited toward more than one participation goal.

   (b) Whenever an agency believes that a contractor or a subcontractor is not in compliance with § 6-129 of the administrative code of the city of New York, these rules, or any provision of a contract that implements § 6-129 of the administrative code of the city of New York or these rules, including, but not limited to any contractor utilization plan, the agency must send a written notice to the city chief procurement officer, the division and the contractor describing the alleged noncompliance and offering the contractor an opportunity to be heard.

      (x) exercise rights under the contract to procure goods, services or construction from another contractor and charge the cost of such contract to the contractor that has been found to be in noncompliance; or

      (xi) take any other appropriate remedy.

The contracting agency must submit a copy of such submission to the division.

(6) Whenever an agency has reason to believe that an MBE, WBE or EBE is not qualified for certification, or is participating in a contract in a manner that does not serve a commercially useful function, or has violated any provision of § 6-129 of the administrative code of the city of New York or these rules, the agency must notify the commissioner who will determine whether the certification of such business enterprise should be revoked.

(7) Statements made in any instrument submitted to an agency pursuant to these rules will be submitted under penalty of perjury and any false or misleading statement or omission will be grounds for the application of any applicable criminal and/or civil penalties for perjury. The making of a false or fraudulent statement by an MBE, WBE or EBE in any instrument submitted pursuant to these rules will, in addition, be grounds for revocation of its certification.

(8) A contractor's record in implementing its contractor utilization plan will be a factor in the evaluation of its performance. Whenever a contracting agency determines that a contractor's compliance with a contractor utilization plan has been unsatisfactory, the agency must, after consultation with the city chief procurement officer, file an advice of caution form for inclusion in VENDEX as caution data.

(9) Any complaint alleging fraud, corruption or other criminal behavior on the part of a bidder, proposer, contractor, subcontractor or supplier must in addition be referred to the department of investigation.

   (4) Any business enterprise that satisfies the eligibility criteria as set forth in 66 RCNY § 11-82 is presumptively eligible for certification under these rules; provided that the commissioner may decline to certify, or revoke the certification of, any business enterprise on the ground that there is not a firm basis for believing that there is a compelling state interest to justify certification of that business enterprise under these rules.

(e) Evidence of social and economic disadvantage.

   (1) (A) Evidence of individual social disadvantage must include the following elements:

         (i) At least one objective distinguishing feature that has contributed to social disadvantage, such as physical or mental disability, long-term residence in an environment isolated from the mainstream of United States society, or other similar causes not common to individuals who are not socially disadvantaged;

         (ii) Personal experiences of substantial and chronic social disadvantage in United States society, not in other countries; and

         (iii) Negative impact on entry into or advancement in the business world because of the social disadvantage. DSBS will consider any relevant evidence in assessing this element. In every case, however, DSBS will consider education, employment and business history, where applicable, to see if the totality of circumstances shows disadvantage in entering into or advancing in the business world.

      (B) Education. DSBS will consider such factors as denial of equal access to institutions of higher education, exclusion from social and professional association with students or teachers, denial of educational honors rightfully earned, and social patterns or pressures which discouraged the individual from pursuing a professional or business education.

      (C) Employment. DSBS will consider such factors as unequal treatment in hiring, promotions and other aspects of professional advancement, pay and fringe benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment; retaliatory or discriminatory behavior by an employer; and social patterns or pressures which have channeled the individual into nonprofessional or non-business fields.

      (D) Business history. DSBS will consider such factors as unequal access to credit or capital, acquisition of credit or capital under commercially unfavorable circumstances, unequal treatment in opportunities for government contracts or other work, unequal treatment by potential customers and business associates, and exclusion from business or professional organizations.

   (2) Evidence of individual economic disadvantage must include the following elements:

      (A) Submission of narrative and financial information.

         (i) Each individual claiming economic disadvantage must describe it in a narrative statement, and must submit personal financial information supporting the assertions contained in the narrative statement.

         (ii) An individual claiming economic disadvantage who is married or a member of a domestic partnership must submit separate financial information for his or her spouse or domestic partner, provided that such financial information will not be required where the individual and the spouse are legally separated.

      (B) DSBS evaluation of diminished capital and credit opportunities. DSBS will examine factors relating to the personal financial condition of any individual claiming disadvantaged status, including personal income for the past two years (including bonuses and the value of company stock given in lieu of cash), personal net worth, and the fair market value of all assets, whether encumbered or not. DSBS will also consider the financial condition of the applicant compared to the financial profiles of small businesses in the same primary industry classification, or, if not available, in similar lines of business, which are not owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in evaluating the individual's access to credit and capital. The financial profiles that DSBS compares will include total assets, net sales, pre-tax profit, sales/working capital ratio, and net worth.

      (C) Transfers within two years.

         (1) Except as set forth in 66 RCNY § 11-82(e)(2)(C)(2), DSBS will attribute to an individual claiming disadvantaged status any assets which that individual has transferred to an immediate family member, or to a trust a beneficiary of which is an immediate family member, for less than fair market value, within two years prior to a business enterprise's application for participation in the EBE program or within two years of a participant's annual renewal, unless the individual claiming disadvantaged status can demonstrate that the transfer is to or on behalf of an immediate family member for that individual's education, medical expenses, or some other form of essential support.

         (2) DSBS will not attribute to an individual claiming disadvantaged status any assets transferred by that individual to an immediate family member that are consistent with the customary recognition of special occasions, such as birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, and retirements.

         (3) In determining an individual's access to capital and credit, DSBS may consider any assets that the individual transferred within such two-year period described by 66 RCNY § 11-82(e)(2)(C)(1), that DSBS does not consider in evaluating the individual's assets and net worth (e.g., transfers to charities).

(f) Net worth. For EBE eligibility, the net worth of an individual claiming disadvantage must be less than one million dollars. In determining such net worth, DSBS will exclude the ownership interest in the applicant and the applicant's equity in the primary personal residence (except any portion of such equity which is attributable to excessive withdrawals from the applicant). Exclusions for purposes of determining net worth are not exclusions for asset valuation or access to capital and credit purposes. A contingent liability does not reduce an individual's net worth.

(g) * Graduate EBE determinations. The division will, upon reviewing applications for certification and recertification, determine whether a business enterprise qualifies as a graduate EBE. The division will make such determinations in accordance with the following procedures:

   (1) In the event that the division determines a business enterprise seeking new certification as an EBE qualifies as a graduate EBE pursuant to 66 RCNY § 11-81, the division will provide a written notice of such determination to the applicant business enterprise stating the reason(s) for such determination and the procedures for challenging the graduate EBE determination.

   (2) In the event that the division determines a certified EBE qualifies as a graduate EBE pursuant to 66 RCNY § 11-81, the division will provide a written notice of such determination to the business enterprise seeking recertification setting forth the reason(s) for such determination and the procedures for challenging the graduate EBE determination.

   (3) In the event that the division determines a business enterprise seeking new certification or a certified EBE to be a graduate EBE pursuant to 66 RCNY § 11-81, the business enterprise may challenge such a determination pursuant to the procedures set forth in 66 RCNY §§ 11-84 and 11-85.

   (4) In the event that the division has determined a business enterprise to be a graduate EBE, and the business enterprise has not made a timely challenge to that determination, or has made such a challenge and the department has affirmed its determination, the business enterprise may not apply to have the designation lifted for at least two years from the date of the original determination notice.

1. Identify the Borough, Block and Lot (BBL) for a property at: http://maps.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/.

2. Look for the corresponding Block and Lot below in Chart A.

3. If the BBL is on Chart A, the property is affected by the Jerome Avenue Rezoning. Then, look across the row to identify the property's New Zoning District and Commercial Overlay.

4. Next, to identify if the business use on the property is permitted in its New Zoning District and/or the Commercial Overlay, go to: https://zr.planning.nyc.gov/appendix-index-uses. This site lists the different types of uses or business activity and the districts in which the use is permitted. Find the use for the business on the property and identify if the use is permitted in its New Zoning District or Commercial Overlay.

5. If the business' use is not permitted in its New Zoning District or the Commercial Overlay, the Applicant may be eligible for a grant.
