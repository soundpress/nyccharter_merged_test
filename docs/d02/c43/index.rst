This includes the submission of forms requesting information required for the "doing business database" established by Local Law 34 for the year 2007, and must include all of the information and documents required by such instructions and forms. For purposes of the acquisition of property by the City, pursuant to 62 RCNY §§ 2-01(e) and 2-01(k), the applicant shall be the requesting agency and the Department of Citywide Administrative Services. For purposes of the approval of housing or urban renewal plans and projects or amendments thereof pursuant to City, State or Federal laws in accordance with 62 RCNY § 2-01(h), the applicant shall be the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development or the New York City Housing Authority, as appropriate, or their designees. The Department may not consider the application as filed unless it includes all required components and shall not consider the application as filed unless the required fee has been paid or is paid concurrently with the submission of the application.

   (2) Initial Review. The Department of City Planning shall, within five (5) days, review each application to ensure that all required forms, documents and other exhibits supplied have been submitted and prepared as required by the instructions. If any of the documentation is missing or has been improperly prepared, the applicant will be notified that the submitted application has been rejected, along with a listing of its deficiencies If the documentation is in order, the Department shall assign a docket number and shall transmit a Notice of Receipt of the application to all the appropriate Department divisions and other agencies which review such application, and to the community board(s), Borough President(s), borough board (when appropriate), the City Council and the applicant in accordance with 62 RCNY § 2-02(b). Such Notice of Receipt, when sent to the community board(s), Borough President(s), borough boards and City Council shall include a copy of the application form and all documents included therewith.

   (3) Substantive Review. The application form, documents and other exhibits shall be subject to review by the appropriate divisions of the Department in order to ensure that the requirements for completeness in 62 RCNY § 2-02(a)(5) have been met prior to certification of the application into ULURP. The Department may request any additional documents, maps, plans, drawings or information necessary to complete or organize the submission, or to clarify its substance and the land use issues attendant to it. The Department of City Planning shall refer such additional application documents or amendments within five (5) days to each affected borough president, community board or borough board, and to the City Council. Not later than sixty (60) days after the Notice of Receipt has been sent, the Department of City Planning shall notify the applicant of any deficiencies or errors in the application, documents and other exhibits, and shall make any requests for revised or supplementary documents and exhibits. The applicant is expected to respond within a reasonable time. Upon receipt of the corrected, revised or supplementary material, the Department of City Planning shall review it within no more than sixty (60) days and make any additional request for further corrections or supplements if needed. If the applicant fails to respond within sixty (60) days after the receipt of a request for revisions, corrections or supplement, the Department of City Planning shall give notice to the applicant that the application will be deemed withdrawn.

   (4) Appeal for Certification. At any time after one hundred and eighty (180) days have elapsed from the date of the Notice of Receipt of any application, the applicant may appeal in writing to the Commission to certify the application as complete. The affected Borough President may also appeal in writing if the Borough President finds that the application is consistent with the land use policy or strategic policy statement of the borough formulated pursuant to § 82, subsection 14 of the Charter. Upon receipt of such an appeal, the Commission shall refer it to the Department of City Planning and the Office of Environmental Coordination or lead agency for an evaluation of the completeness of the application, which shall include an identification of all material requested by the Department of City Planning and the environmental review staff or lead agency but not yet provided by the applicant. If the Commission determines that all pertinent information has been supplied in accordance with the criteria of 62 RCNY § 2-02(a)(5) below, it shall certify the application as complete. If the Commission determines that pertinent information has not been supplied, such information shall be listed by the Department of City Planning and the environmental review staff and sent by the Commission to the applicant within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal. When the applicant has responded, either by supplying all the information so requested, or by explaining why such information should not be required in order to certify the application, the Commission shall consider the evaluation and the applicant's response and either certify the application as complete in accordance with 62 RCNY § 2-02(a)(5) or deny the appeal. A denial by the Commission shall state the information that must still be supplied or clearly state the reason for denial. Such determination shall be made not later than sixty (60) days from the date the appeal is received. If the appeal is one which has been made by the affected Borough President, and the land use proposed in the application is consistent with the land use policy or strategic policy statement of the affected Borough President, then a vote of five members shall be sufficient to certify the application as complete in accordance with 62 RCNY § 2-02(a)(5) below. In all other instances, a majority vote of the Commission is necessary to certify an application. A denial of the appeal shall mean that the application remains incomplete, and the Department of City Planning and the environmental review staff shall continue with timely review of the application until all the information required for completeness has been provided at which time certification shall take place. If such review continues for an additional one hundred and eighty (180) days or more beyond the denial, the applicant may again appeal to the Commission under the procedure outlined above to certify the application.

   (5) Certification of Completeness. The Department or the Commission shall certify the application as complete when compliance has been achieved with all of the following:

      (i) The standard application form, including for any application certified on or after April 14, 2008, forms requesting information required for the "doing business database" established pursuant to Local Law 34 for the year 2007, has been completed in its entirety with all requested information presented in clear language.

      (ii) All accompanying documents, maps, plans, drawings, and other information are properly organized and presented in clear language and understandable graphic form.

      (iii) The information supplied on the application form and accompanying documents is fully sufficient to address all issues of jurisdiction and substance which are required to be addressed for the category of action as defined in the Charter, statutes, Zoning Resolution, Administrative Code or other law or regulation.

      (iv) All reviews by necessary and related agencies of the State and City have been completed and any required reports, certifications, sign-offs or other such agency actions required by law or regulation prior to ULURP have been secured, or a written waiver of the agency presented. If any such agency does not respond within sixty (60) days, it will be deemed to have waived its review and action as applicable law permits.

      (v) A determination has been made whether the action is subject to City or State Environmental Quality Review, and if so subject, the lead agency has issued either:

         (A) a Negative or Conditional Negative Declaration; or

         (B) a Notice of Acceptance of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement.

      (vi) Notification of any proposed (E) designation has been submitted to the Department of City Planning as required pursuant to 62 RCNY § 2-02(e) hereof.

(b) Referrals: general provisions. Except as provided in 62 RCNY § 2-02(c) hereof, within nine (9) calendar days after the certification by the Department of City Planning, or by the Commission if certification occurs pursuant to 62 RCNY § 2-02(a)(4) above, that a submission is a complete application, the Department of City Planning shall make the following referrals:

Such requests shall be subject to the application and certification procedure of 62 RCNY § 2-02(a) hereof and shall be referred pursuant to 62 RCNY § 2-02(b) hereof.

Upon the filing of such a statement, the application in question shall be void and no further processing of such application under this uniform land use review procedure shall be undertaken by a community board, Borough President, borough board or the Commission. The Commission shall promptly give notice of such withdrawal to the board or boards, to the Borough President to which the application was referred pursuant to 62 RCNY § 2-02(b) and to the Council, if filings pursuant to 62 RCNY § 2-06(h)(4) have not occurred.

Such notification shall be by the lead agency, as defined in 6 New York Code of Rules and Regulations, Part 617, as amended, and 62 RCNY § 5-02, as amended.

   (2) General character. Hearings shall be legislative type hearings, without sworn testimony or strict rules of evidence.

The community board may include in its submission the reasons for the vote and any conditions attached to its vote. The community board may state that its conditional approval shall be considered a negative recommendation for purposes of Charter § 197-d(b)(2) if conditions that it considers essential to minimize land use or environmental impacts are not adopted by the Commission. The City Planning Commission shall give consideration only to those conditions which are related to land use and environmental aspects of the application.

   (4) Submission. A community board shall submit its recommendation or waiver promptly after adoption, to the Commission, to the Borough President, to the applicant and, in the case of an application referred to two or more community boards and a borough board, to such borough board. If a community board fails to act within the time limits for review the application shall be deemed referred to the next level of review at the completion of the community board's time period.

(g) Requests for review of action not in a community district. A community board or borough board may obtain the filed application and supporting documents for any action subject to ULURP which is not located within the district boundaries of such community board or borough board. Such community board or borough board may request review of such applications by writing, either to the Calendar Office of the Commission, or requesting through the Department's website, and it shall state the basis for the board's judgment that the application may significantly affect the welfare of the district or borough served by such board. Thereafter, the community board or borough board may schedule a public hearing on the application, such hearing and notice thereof to be in conformance with 62 RCNY §§ 2-03(c), 2-03(d), 2-05(c) and 2-05(d) and may submit a written recommendation to the Commission. The Commission may receive such recommendation at any time prior to its final action on the application; however, it shall have no authority to extend the review period defined in Charter § 197-c, nor shall a review by a second community board pursuant to this subparagraph (g) require that the application be reviewed by the borough board.

The Commission may also transmit any comment or recommendation with respect to the substance of the modification, and any proposed further amendment to the modification which it deems as necessary or appropriate. If the Commission has determined that the proposed modification will require a supplementary environmental review or the initiation of a new application, it shall so advise the Council in a written statement which includes the reasons for its determination.

Chapter 4: Procedures for New York City Waterfront Revitalization Program (WRP) Consistency Review by the City Coastal Commission and the Department of City Planning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 4-01 Applicability.*


This chapter sets forth the procedures applicable to the review of actions located in the New York City Coastal Zone by the City Planning Commission (the Commission), in its capacity as the City Coastal Commission (CCC), and by the Department of City Planning (the Department) as provided in the WRP. Three separate categories of actions are subject to such review process:

(a) Local discretionary actions that are classified as Type 1 or Unlisted pursuant to the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) or City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR);

(b) State actions that are subject to WRP consistency review by the relevant state agency pursuant to the applicable laws and regulations referenced in 62 RCNY § 4-03(b);

(c) Federal direct actions, permit and license actions, and financial assistance actions that are subject to WRP consistency review by the New York State Department of State (DOS) for the relevant federal agency pursuant to the applicable laws and regulations referenced in 62 RCNY § 4-03(b).

The Department's or the CCC's review of state and federal actions, as referenced herein, is advisory and for the purpose of consultation in accordance with state and federal laws and regulations.








*§ 4-02 CCC and Department Review.*


As the administrator of the WRP with the CCC, the Department is responsible for coordinating all WRP consistency reviews. The Department evaluates all actions covered by 62 RCNY § 4-01 to determine which warrant CCC review, in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section. The Department reviews all actions covered by this chapter that do not warrant CCC review.

The CCC reviews:

(a) Local actions that are subject to Commission approval pursuant to the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) or other provision of the City Charter, including those for which the Commission is the designated CEQR lead agency; and

(b) Local, state or federal actions that, in the Department's view, would substantially hinder the achievement of one or more policies of the WRP.








*§ 4-03 Reviews for Consistency with the WRP.*


(a) Local actions. Except as provided in 62 RCNY § 4-04(a), no CEQR lead or involved agency may make a final decision to undertake, fund, or approve an action unless and until the lead agency, or the CCC when the lead agency is the Commission, finds that such action will not substantially hinder the achievement of any WRP policy and determines that the action is consistent with the WRP, in accordance with the standards set forth in the WRP. When the lead agency is other than the Commission, the Department must concur with such finding.

   (1) Local actions subject to Commission approval. The CCC's review of actions for consistency with the WRP is incorporated into the Commission's existing review procedures pursuant to ULURP or other provision of the Charter, or pursuant to CEQR.

   (2) Local actions not subject to Commission approval.

      (i) The CEQR lead agency shall provide the Department with its draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or draft Environmental Assessment Statement (EAS), whichever is applicable, containing the agency's draft WRP consistency assessment and determination, at the earliest possible date, and in no event less than thirty (30) days before issuance of a Negative Declaration, a Conditional Negative Declaration or, if the agency has prepared a draft EIS, a Notice of Completion. The Department may request additional information to assist in the evaluation of the proposed action, which the agency shall promptly provide.

      (ii) Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the lead agency's draft WRP consistency assessment and determination, the Department will notify the lead agency as to whether the Department concurs or does not concur with the proposed consistency determination and will provide written comments on the assessment, if any.

      (iii) When the lead agency has prepared an EAS, if the Department is properly notified of such agency's consistency assessment and determination and does not respond to such agency in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt, the lead agency may deem its consistency determination to have been accepted by the Department.

(b) State and federal actions. The coordination of the Department's or the CCC's review of state and federal actions with the relevant state agency and DOS, respectively, including review periods and the procedures for transmission of comments and findings, shall be in accordance with the relevant state and federal laws and regulations, including Article 42 of the New York State Executive Law (§§ 910 through 922) and 16 U.S.C. §§ 1451 et seq., respectively, and shall follow the guidelines for notification and review of federal and state actions, which are appended to the WRP.

(c) Inconsistency with the WRP. For all actions, where an inconsistency with one or more policies of the WRP has been identified, the Department or the CCC, as applicable, may recommend alternatives or modifications to the action or mitigation measures in order to avoid or minimize the inconsistency. If, in the Department's or the CCC's view, an inconsistency presents a substantial hindrance to the achievement of one or more policies of the WRP, the provisions of 62 RCNY § 4-04 shall apply.

(d) Public Notice. All actions will be subject to any applicable procedures for public notice for the action under review. There are no additional public notice or participation requirements pursuant to this chapter.








*§ 4-04 Substantial Hindrance to the WRP.*


(a) Local actions.

   (1) Local actions subject to Commission approval. The Commission may not approve an action that will substantially hinder the achievement of one or more policies of the WRP, unless, in its capacity as the CCC, it makes the following four findings:

      i. No reasonable alternatives exist which would permit the action to be taken in a manner which would not substantially hinder the achievement of such policy;

      ii. The action taken will minimize all adverse effects on such policies to the maximum extent practicable;

      iii. The action will advance one or more of the other coastal policies; and

      iv. The action will result in an overriding local or regional public benefit.

   (2) Local actions not subject to Commission approval. A CEQR lead or involved agency may not undertake, fund, or approve an action that will substantially hinder the achievement of one or more policies of theWRP unless the CEQR lead agency makes the four findings in paragraph 1 of this subdivision with the concurrence of the CCC.

   Where the findings set forth in paragraph 1 of this subdivision are met, the action shall be deemed consistent with the WRP.

(b) State and federal actions. The CCC shall provide an advisory determination as to whether the four findings set forth in paragraph 1 of subdivision a are met. The Department shall transmit the CCC's findings to the relevant state agency or DOS for the purpose of consultation in accordance with the WRP and applicable state and federal laws, regulations and published guidelines, as referenced in subdivision b of 62 RCNY § 4-03.






Chapter 5: City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 5-01 Source of Authority and Statement of Purpose.*


Section 192(e) of the Charter provides that the City Planning Commission "shall oversee implementation of laws that require environmental reviews of actions taken by the city" and that the Commission "shall establish by rule procedures for environmental reviews of proposed actions by the city where such reviews are required by law." These rules are intended to exercise that mandate by redefining lead agencies within the city in accordance with law, prescribing the relationship of the new Office of Environmental Coordination with those agencies and regulating scoping. The organization and numbering of the various sections of these rules are not intended to correspond precisely to Executive Order 91. [;43 RCNY Chapter 6, also, see Appendix A hereto];. Rather, these rules are an overlay on Executive Order 91. Where these rules conflict with Executive Order 91, these rules supersede the Executive Order. In deciding upon the appropriate lead agency for certain classes of actions taken by the city, the City Planning Commission has selected the involved agency "principally responsible for carrying out, funding or approving" those actions. 6 NYCRR § 617.2(v). For private ULURP applications, for § 197-a plans and for all actions primarily involving a zoning map or text change, the City Planning Commission, responsible under the Charter "for the conduct of planning relating to the orderly growth, improvement and future development of the city" (Charter § 192(d)), is the lead agency. For other ULURP applications, the city agency applicant, the agency that will generally be involved with ensuring programmatic implementation of the action, is the lead agency. Most of the remaining lead agency designations in the rules similarly address other approvals required by the Charter by designating the agency charged with ensuring programmatic implementation as the lead agency for those approvals. In appropriate cases, a lead agency designated by the rules may transfer its lead agency status to another involved agency. The rules ensure that lead agencies have access to the technical and administrative expertise of the Office of Environmental Coordination. Finally, the rules provide for involved and interested agencies, including the City Council, to participate in the environmental review process, and ensure a role for the public in scoping.






*§ 5-02 General Provisions.*


(a) Continuation of Executive Order No. 91 [43 RCNY §§ 6-01 et seq.] [See Appendix A to these rules]. Until the City Planning Commission promulgates further rules governing environmental review of actions taken by the city, Executive Order No. 91 of August 24, 1977, as amended (Executive Order 91), shall continue to govern environmental quality review in the city except where inconsistent with these rules, provided, however, that the following provisions of Executive Order 91 shall not apply: the definitions of "Agency", "Lead Agencies" and "Project data statement" defined in 43 RCNY § 6-02, 43 RCNY § 6-03(b), 43 RCNY § 6-05(a), the introductory paragraph of 43 RCNY § 6-05(b), paragraphs one and two of 43 RCNY § 6-12(a), 43 RCNY § 6-14, and subdivision (b) of the TYPE II part of 43 RCNY § 6-15.

   (2) Wherever Executive Order 91 explicitly or by implication refers to subdivision (b) of the Type II part of 43 RCNY § 6-15, such reference shall be deemed to be to § 617.13(d) of the SEQRA Regulations.

   (3) The reference to "a determination pursuant to 43 RCNY § 6-03(b)" contained in 43 RCNY § 6-05(b)(1) shall be deemed to refer to selection of a lead agency pursuant to 62 RCNY § 5-03.

   (4) The Office of Environmental Coordination shall succeed to functions performed by the City Clerk pursuant to Executive Order 91 with respect to the receipt and filing of documents.

   (5) References in these rules and in Executive Order 91 to specific agencies and provisions of law shall be deemed to apply to successor agencies and provisions of law.

(c) Definitions. 

   (1) All definitions contained in Executive Order 91, other than the definitions of "agency" and "lead agencies", shall apply to these rules.

   (2) "Action" as defined in 43 RCNY § 6-02, includes all contemporaneous or subsequent actions that are included in a review pursuant to City Environmental Quality Review.

   (3) The following additional definitions shall apply to these rules unless otherwise noted:

      Agency. "Agency" shall mean any agency, administration, department, board, commission, council, governing body or other governmental entity of the city of New York, including but not limited to community boards, borough boards and the offices of the borough presidents, unless otherwise specifically referred to as a state or federal agency.

      City Environmental Quality Review. "City Environmental Quality Review" (CEQR) shall mean the environmental quality review procedure established by Executive Order 91 as modified by these rules.

      Determination of Significance. "Determination of significance" shall mean a negative declaration, conditional negative declaration or notice of determination (positive declaration).

      Interested Agency. "Interested agency" shall mean an agency that lacks jurisdiction to fund, approve or directly undertake an action but requests or is requested to participate in the review process because of its specific concern or expertise about the proposed action.

      Involved Agency. "Involved agency" shall mean any agency that has jurisdiction to fund, approve or directly undertake an action pursuant to any provision of law, including but not limited to the Charter or any local law or resolution. The City Council shall be an involved agency for all actions for which, as a component of the approval procedure for the action or a part thereof, the City Council has the power to approve or disapprove, regardless of whether the City Council chooses to exercise such power.

      Lead Agency. "Lead agency" shall mean the agency principally responsible for environmental review pursuant to these rules.

      Scoping. "Scoping" shall mean the process by which the lead agency identifies the significant issues related to the proposed action which are to be addressed in the draft environmental impact statement including, where possible, the content and level of detail of the analysis, the range of alternatives, the mitigation measures needed to minimize or eliminate adverse impacts, and the identification of non-relevant issues.

      SEQRA Regulations. "SEQRA Regulations" shall mean Part 617 of Volume 6 of New York Codes, Rules and Regulations.

(d) Applicability. These rules and Executive Order 91 shall apply to environmental review by the city that is required by the State Environmental Quality Review Act (Environmental Conservation Law, Article 8) and regulations of the State Department of Environmental Conservation thereunder and shall not be construed to require environmental quality review of an action where such review would not otherwise be required by such act and regulations, or to dispense with any such review where it is otherwise required.






*§ 5-03 Establishment of Lead Agency.*


(a) General Rule. Where only one agency is involved in an action, that agency shall be the lead agency.

(b) Actions Subject to ULURP and Charter Sections 197-a, 200, 201, and 668. 

   (1) For actions subject to the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure of § 197-c of the Charter (ULURP), and for which the applicant is not a city agency, the City Planning Commission shall be the lead agency.

   (2) For actions that involve plans for the development, growth and improvement of the city, its boroughs and community districts (Charter § 197-a), the City Planning Commission shall be the lead agency.

   (3) For actions that involve zoning map or text changes (Charter § 200 and/or 201), the following rules shall apply:

      (i) If the only approval subject to ULURP or to Charter § 200 or 201 is a zoning map or text change, the City Planning Commission shall be the lead agency.

      (ii) If the applicant for any action requiring a zoning map or text change is not a city agency, the City Planning Commission shall be the lead agency.

      (iii) If the action involves a zoning map or text change, in addition to another approval under Charter § 197-c (ULURP) for which there is a city agency applicant, then the city agency applicant shall be the lead agency, provided, however, that the City Planning Commission shall be the lead agency if:

         (A) The action involves a zoning map or text change that covers or may apply to areas substantially larger than the properties covered by the non-zoning approvals required under Charter § 197-c; or

         (B) The city agency applicant and the Chair of the City Planning Commission agree that the action involves a zoning map or text change that changes the uses permitted so as to substantially alter the area zoning pattern.

   (4) For all other actions subject to § 197-c of the Charter (ULURP) for which the applicant is a city agency, and for actions subject to § 668 of the Charter for which the applicant is a city agency, the city agency applicant shall be the lead agency. Where there is more than one city agency applicant, the city agency applicants shall agree upon which of them will be the lead agency, using the selection procedure set forth in subdivision (h) of this section.

   (5) Where no other provision of this section applies and an action involves a special permit or variance from the Board of Standards and Appeals (Charter § 668) for which the applicant is not a city agency, the Board of Standards and Appeals shall be the lead agency.

(c) Section 195 Acquisitions of Office Space or Existing Buildings for Office Use. For actions involving acquisitions of office space or existing buildings for office use (Charter § 195), the agency filing the notice of intent to acquire shall be the lead agency.

(d) Local Laws. The City Council and the Office of the Mayor shall be co-lead agencies for local laws. Either agency may at any time delegate to the other its lead agency status and act instead as an involved agency. In addition, after introduction of a proposed local law, the City Council may assume sole lead agency status after giving the Mayor five days notice.

(e) Franchises, Revocable Consents, and Concessions. For actions involving franchises, revocable consents and concessions, the responsible agency as defined in Charter § 362(c) shall be the lead agency.

For actions involving the leasing of wharf property belonging to the city primarily for purposes of waterfront commerce or in furtherance of navigation (Charter § 1301(2)(f)), the Department of Business Services shall be the lead agency, provided that the Department of Transportation shall be the lead agency for such actions when it is acting pursuant to Charter § 2903(c)(2). For actions involving determinations of the Commissioner of Business Services pursuant to Charter § 1302 (waterfront plans), the Department of Ports and Trade shall be the lead agency.

(g) Selection of Lead Agency in the Case of Multiple Involved Agencies. 

   (1) Subdivision (b) of this section, which governs lead agency designation for actions involving approvals pursuant to ULURP or § 197-a, 200, 201 or 668 of the Charter, shall always govern determination of the lead agency regardless of whether the action involves additional approvals pursuant to other provisions of law.

   (2) For any other action involving more than one agency, the agencies designated in subdivisions (c) through (f) of this section and any agencies involved in any required city approval, other than approvals described in such subdivisions, shall agree upon which of them will be the lead agency, using the selection procedure set forth in subdivision (h) of this section.

(h) Procedure for Selection of Lead Agency. In selecting a lead agency where agreement among agencies is required by this section, and in deciding whether transfer of lead agency status is appropriate, the agencies making the selection or decision shall determine which agency is most appropriate to act as lead agency for the particular action. In making such determination, such agencies shall consider, but shall not be limited to considering, the following criteria:

   (1) The agency that will have the greater degree of responsibility for planning and implementing the action;

   (2) The agency that will be involved for a longer duration;

   (3) The agency that has the greater capability for providing the most thorough environmental assessment;

   (4) The agency that has the more general governmental powers as compared to single or limited powers or purposes;

   (5) The agency that will provide the greater level of funding for the action;

   (6) The agency that will act earlier on the proposed action; and

   (7) The agency that has the greater role in determining the policies resulting in or affecting the proposed action.

(i) Transfer of Lead Agency Status. Lead agency status may be transferred from the lead agency, at its discretion, to an involved agency that agrees to become the lead agency. In deciding whether a transfer of lead agency status is appropriate, agencies shall use the selection procedure set forth in subdivision (h) of this section. Notice of transfer of lead agency status must be given by the new lead agency to the applicant and all other involved and interested agencies within 10 days of the transfer. The Chair of the City Planning Commission may act on behalf of such Commission pursuant to this subdivision.

(j) Selection of Lead Agency Where Actions Involve City and State Agencies. Where an action involves both city and state agencies, the city agency prescribed by or selected pursuant to subdivisions (a) through (i) of this section shall, together with such state agencies, participate in selection of the lead agency pursuant to SEQRA, and such selection shall be binding upon the city. The criteria set forth in § 617.6(e)(5) of the SEQRA Regulations shall be considered in deciding whether or not a city agency shall serve as lead agency. The Office of Environmental Coordination shall perform the functions set forth in subdivision (d) of 62 RCNY § 5-04.






*§ 5-04 The Office of Environmental Coordination.*


(a) The Director of City Planning and the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection shall designate persons from the staffs of the Departments of City Planning and Environmental Protection who shall comprise the Office of Environmental Coordination (OEC). The OEC shall provide assistance to all city agencies in fulfilling their environmental review responsibilities.

(b) The OEC shall perform any environmental review function assigned to it by a lead agency, except the OEC may not issue, amend or rescind a determination of significance, notice of completion of a draft or final environmental impact statement, written findings following issuance of a final environmental impact statement, or analogous statements, notices or findings for a supplemental environmental impact statement. In addition, the lead agency may not delegate to the OEC its responsibility to issue the final scope or to attend the scoping meeting; however, the lead agency may delegate to the OEC the power to chair the scoping meeting.

(c) In addition to any other functions the OEC may perform pursuant to these rules, the OEC shall:

   (1) Work with appropriate city agencies to develop and maintain technical standards and methodologies for environmental review and, upon request, assist in the application by agencies of such standards and methodologies;

   (2) Work with appropriate city agencies to develop and maintain a technical database that may be utilized by applicants and city agencies in completing the standardized environmental assessment statement described in this subdivision and in preparation of draft and final environmental impact statements;

   (3) Prepare and maintain a standardized environmental assessment statement, which shall provide guidance in determining whether the action may have a significant effect on the environment;

   (4) At the request of a lead agency, coordinate the work of the technical staffs of interested agencies in order to complete environmental review, and expedite responses by interested agencies to requests of the lead agency;

   (5) (i) Receive and maintain on file notifications of commencement of environmental review, determinations of significance (including completed environmental assessment statements), draft and final scopes issued pursuant to 62 RCNY § 5-07, draft and final environmental impact statements, and significant supporting documentation comprising the official records of environmental reviews,

      (ii) provide to the public upon request, or make available for inspection by the public during normal business hours, materials maintained on file pursuant to this paragraph,

      (iii) publish a quarterly listing of all notifications of commencement, determinations of significance, draft and final scopes and draft and final environmental impact statements received and filed pursuant to this paragraph, and

      (iv) in its discretion, advise lead agencies as to whether such documents are consistent with standards and methodologies developed pursuant to this subdivision and reflect proper use of the standardized environmental assessment statement;

   (6) Provide to lead agencies staff training, management assistance, model procedures, coordination with other agencies, and other strategies intended to remedy any problems that arise with respect to consistency with standards and methodologies developed pursuant to this subdivision or proper use of the standardized environmental assessment statement;

   (7) Provide to lead agencies a format for notices of public scoping meetings, assist lead agencies in ensuring that public scoping meetings are conducted in an effective manner, and, to the extent the OEC deems appropriate, comment on the draft scope and participate in such meetings;

   (8) Prepare standardized forms for notifications of commencement of environmental review, determinations of significance, notices of completion of draft and final environmental impact statements, and, as may be appropriate, other environmental review documents; and

   (9) Work with appropriate city agencies to develop and implement a tracking system to ensure that mitigation measures are implemented in a timely manner, and to evaluate and report on the effectiveness of mitigation measures.

(d) Any state agency that seeks a determination whether a city agency shall serve as the lead agency for an action that involves city and state agencies should initially communicate with the OEC. Upon receipt of such communication, the OEC shall ascertain the city agency which is designated as lead agency by or pursuant to these rules and shall notify such agency of such communication. Such designated agency may then act pursuant to subdivision (j) of § 3 of these rules.

(e) Where an action or part thereof has been or will be reviewed by a federal agency, the OEC shall assist city agencies in coordinating review with the appropriate federal agency.






*§ 5-05 Environmental Review Procedures.*


(a) Threshold Determination.

   (1) In the case of any action for which a lead agency is prescribed by 62 RCNY § 5-03, and thus for which no agreement among involved agencies is necessary, only such lead agency may determine that such action, considered in its entirety, requires environmental review, and such determination shall be binding upon the city. The OEC shall, upon the request of such agency, assist in such determination.

   (2) In the case of any action for which agreement among involved agencies is necessary for selection of a lead agency, if an agency that could be the lead agency for the particular action pursuant to subdivisions (b) through (g) of 62 RCNY § 5-03 determines that such action may require environmental review, then the lead agency shall be agreed upon as provided in § 3 of these rules, and such lead agency shall determine whether such action, considered in its entirety, requires environmental review. Such determination shall be binding upon the city. The OEC shall assist in any determination made pursuant to this paragraph upon the request of the agency making such determination.

   (3) Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be construed to require an affirmative determination, whether formal or informal, that an action is exempt from environmental review, or is a Type II action pursuant to the SEQRA Regulations, where such determination would not otherwise be required by law.

(b) Other Determinations.

   (1) After the determination that an action requires environmental review, the lead agency shall notify the OEC that it is commencing environmental review and complete or cause to be completed the standardized environmental assessment statement provided by the OEC. Such statement shall provide guidance in determining whether the action may have a significant effect on the environment. The OEC and interested and involved agencies shall, upon the request of the lead agency, assist the lead agency in completing such statement.

   (2) The OEC and interested and involved agencies shall, upon the request of the lead agency, assist such lead agency with respect to any aspect of a determination of significance and/or a draft, final and/or supplemental environmental impact statement.

   (3) Whenever, in the preparation of a draft environmental impact statement, the lead agency identifies a potential significant impact, the lead agency shall consult with any agency that has primary jurisdiction to carry out possible mitigations, and with any city agency that has primary regulatory jurisdiction over the subject matter of such impact.

   (4) Lead agencies shall transmit copies of the following to the OEC upon issuance: notifications of commencement of environmental review, determinations of significance (including completed environmental assessment statements), draft and final scopes, draft and final environmental impact statements. In addition, lead agencies shall forward to the OEC significant supporting documentation comprising the official records of environmental reviews.

(c) Type II. The following actions are not subject to review under City Environmental Quality Review, the State Environmental Quality Review Act (Environmental Conservation Law, Article 8) or the SEQRA Regulations, subject to 62 RCNY § 5-05(d):

      (i) wholly or partially within any historic building, structure, facility, site or district that is calendared for consideration or eligible for designation as a New York City Landmark, Interior Landmark or Scenic Landmark;

      (ii) substantially contiguous to any historic building, structure, facility, site or district that is designated, calendared for consideration or eligible for designation as a New York City Landmark, Interior Landmark or Scenic Landmark; or

      (iii) wholly or partially within or substantially contiguous to any historic building, structure, facility, site or district, or archaeological or prehistoric site that is listed, proposed for listing or eligible for listing on the State Register of Historic Places or National Register of Historic Places.








*§ 5-06 Involved and Interested Agencies; Required Circulation.*


(a) The lead agency and the OEC shall make every reasonable effort to keep involved and interested agencies informed during the environmental review process and to facilitate their participation in such process. If the City Council is involved in an action, staff of the lead agency and/or staff of the OEC shall be made available to explain determinations made by the lead agency to the City Council or the appropriate City Council committee or staff.

(b) Any written information submitted by an applicant for the lead agency to determine whether an environmental impact statement will be required by law, and documents or records intended to define or substantially redefine the overall scope of issues to be addressed in any draft environmental impact statement required by law, shall be transmitted to all affected community or borough boards, where such transmission is required by the Charter.

(c) If the City Council is involved in an action, any written information, documents or records that are required to be transmitted to involved agencies or to affected community boards or borough boards shall be transmitted to the City Council.








*§ 5-07 Scoping.*


After a notice of determination (positive declaration) is issued, the lead agency shall coordinate the scoping process, which shall ensure that all interested and involved agencies (including the City Council where it is interested or involved), the applicant, the OEC, community and borough boards, borough presidents and the public are able to participate. The scoping process shall include a public scoping meeting and take place in accordance with the following procedure:

(a) Draft Scope. Within fifteen days after a notice of determination (positive declaration) is issued, the lead agency shall issue a draft scope, which may be prepared by the applicant but must be approved by the lead agency. The lead agency may consult with the OEC and other agencies prior to issuance of the draft scope.

(b) Public Notice and Comment. Upon issuance of the draft scope and not less than thirty nor more than forty-five days prior to the holding of the public scoping meeting, the lead agency shall publish in the City Record a notice indicating that a draft environmental impact statement will be prepared for the proposed action and requesting public comment with respect to the identification of issues to be addressed in the draft environmental impact statement. Such notice shall be in a format provided by the OEC and shall state that the draft scope and the environmental assessment statement may be obtained by any member of the public from the lead agency and/or the OEC. Such notice shall also contain the date, time and place of the public scoping meeting, shall provide that written comments will be accepted by the lead agency through the tenth day following such meeting, and shall set forth guidelines for public participation in such meeting.

(c) Agency Notice and Comment. Upon issuance of the draft scope and not less than thirty nor more than forty-five days prior to the holding of the public scoping meeting, the lead agency shall transmit the draft scope and the environmental assessment statement to all interested and involved agencies (including the City Council where it is interested or involved), to the applicant, to the OEC and to agencies entitled to send representatives to the public scoping meeting pursuant to § 197-c(d) or § 668(a)(7) of the Charter. Together with the draft scope and the environmental assessment statement, a letter shall be transmitted indicating the date, time and place of the public scoping meeting, and stating that comments will be accepted by the lead agency through the tenth day following such meeting. The lead agency may consult with other agencies regarding their comments, and shall forward any written comments received pursuant to this subdivision to the OEC.

(d) Public Scoping Meeting. The lead agency shall chair the public scoping meeting. In addition to the lead agency, all other interested and involved agencies that choose to send representatives (including the City Council where it is interested or involved), the applicant, the OEC, and agencies entitled to send representatives pursuant to § 197-c(d) or § 668(a)(7) of the Charter may participate. The meeting shall include an opportunity for the public to observe discussion among interested and involved agencies, agencies entitled to send representatives, the applicant and the OEC. Reasonable time shall be provided for the public to comment with respect to the identification of issues to be addressed in the draft environmental impact statement. The OEC shall assist the lead agency in ensuring that the public scoping meeting is conducted in an effective manner.

(e) Final Scope. Within thirty days after the public scoping meeting, the lead agency shall issue a final scope, which may be prepared by the applicant and approved by the lead agency. The lead agency may consult further with the OEC and other agencies prior to issuance of the final scope. Where a lead agency receives substantial new information after issuance of a final scope, it may amend the final scope to reflect such information.

(f) Scoping of City Agency Actions. For actions which do not involve private applications, nothing contained in these rules shall be construed to prevent a lead agency, where deemed necessary for complex actions, from extending the time frames for scoping set forth in this section, or from adding additional elements to the scoping process.








*§ 5-08 Applications and Fees.*


(a) Applications. Applications submitted for City Environmental Quality Review for actions that require such review shall be submitted to the lead agency prescribed by these rules, or to an agency that could be the lead agency for the particular action pursuant to 62 RCNY § 5-03. Such applications shall include information required to be obtained from applicants in order for the lead agency to complete or cause to be completed the standardized environmental assessment statement, and such other documents and additional information as the lead agency may require to make a determination of significance. In addition, except as otherwise provided in these rules, such applications shall conform to the requirements of Executive Order 91.

(b) Fees. Except as otherwise provided by this section, fees in effect on the effective date of these rules pursuant to Executive Order 91 and codified as 62 RCNY § 3-02 shall continue to govern City Environmental Quality Review applications, unless the City Planning Commission shall by rule modify such fees. Such fees shall be submitted to the lead agency prescribed by these rules, or to an agency that could be the lead agency for the particular action pursuant to 62 RCNY § 5-03.








*§ 5-09 Transition Section.*


(a) An action shall not be subject to these rules, but shall comply with Executive Order 91, as in effect prior to the effective date of these rules, where:

   (1) a classification as exempt, excluded or Type II has been made prior to the effective date of these rules;

   (2) a project data statement has been completed more than thirty days prior to the effective date of these rules and a determination of significance has not been made prior to the effective date of these rules;

   (3) a negative declaration or a conditional negative declaration has been issued prior to the effective date of these rules; or

   (4) a notice of determination (positive declaration) has been issued more than thirty days prior to the effective date of these rules; provided, however, that if a negative declaration or conditional negative declaration is rescinded, or if a classification as exempt, excluded or Type II is no longer applicable, or if a supplemental environmental impact statement is required, or if a notice of determination (positive declaration) has been issued less than thirty days prior to the effective date of these rules or is issued on or after the effective date of these rules, these rules shall apply, and the lead agency prescribed by or selected pursuant to these rules shall thereupon assume lead agency status at the earliest time practicable.

(b) Except as provided in subdivision (a) of this section, the lead agency prescribed by or selected pursuant to these rules shall assume lead agency status at the earliest time practicable. If a determination of significance has not been made and such lead agency determines that the action requires environmental review, it shall notify the OEC that it is commencing environmental review and shall complete or cause to be completed the standardized environmental assessment statement provided by the OEC, regardless of whether a project data statement has been completed. However, such lead agency shall not be required to engage in scoping pursuant to 62 RCNY § 5-07 if a final scope has already been prepared. Until the lead agency prescribed by or selected pursuant to these rules assumes lead agency status, the action shall be subject to Executive Order 91 as in effect prior to the effective date of these rules; however, after the effective date of these rules, the prior lead agency or agencies shall not issue a determination of significance or notice of completion of a draft or final environmental impact statement, classify an action as exempt, excluded or Type II, convene a scoping meeting or conduct a public hearing pursuant to CEQR.






*§ 5-10 Severability.*


The provisions of these rules shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision or section of these rules, or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstance, shall be held invalid, the remainder of these rules and the application thereof shall not be affected thereby.






*§ 5-11 Effective Date.*


These rules shall take effect on October 1, 1991.

They should not contain more detail than is appropriate considering the nature and magnitude of the proposed action and the significance of its potential impacts.

(b) All draft and final EIS's shall include a cover page stating:

   (1) whether it is a draft or a final;

   (2) the name or other descriptive title of the action;

   (3) the location of the action;

(c) Public hearings on draft EIS.

   (1) Upon completion of a draft EIS, the lead agencies shall conduct a public hearing on the draft EIS.

   (2) The hearing shall commence no less than 15 calendar days or more than 60 calendar days after the filing of a draft EIS pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section, except where a different hearing date is required as appropriate under another law or regulation.

   (3) Notice of the public hearing may be contained in the Notice of Completion or, if not so contained, shall be given in the same manner in which the Notice of Completion is transmitted and filed pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section. In either case, the notice of hearing shall also be published at least 10 calendar days in advance of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the potential impact and effect of the proposed action.

   (4) Where a proposed action is simultaneously subject to ULURP, a public hearing conducted by the appropriate community or borough board and/or the City Planning Commission pursuant to ULURP shall satisfy the hearing requirement of this section. Where more than one hearing is conducted by the aforementioned bodies, whichever hearing last occurs shall be deemed the hearing for purposes of this chapter.






*§ 6-11 Final Environmental Impact Statements – Procedures.*


(a)    (Interested and involved agencies assist with FEIS on request, City Planning Rules 62 RCNY § 5-05(b)(2).) Except as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the lead agencies shall prepare or cause to be prepared a final EIS within 30 calendar days after the close of a public hearing.

   (1) If the proposed action has been withdrawn or if, on the basis of the draft EIS and the hearing, the lead agencies have determined that the action will not have a significant effect on the environment, no final EIS shall be prepared. In such cases, the lead agencies shall prepare, file and transmit a Negative Declaration as prescribed in § 6-07 of this chapter.

   (2) The final EIS shall reflect a revision and updating of the matters contained in the draft EIS in light of further review by the lead agencies, comments received and the record of the public hearing.

(b) Immediately upon the completion of a final EIS, the lead agencies shall prepare, file, transmit and make available for public inspection a Notice of Completion of a final EIS in a manner specified in § 6-11(a) of this chapter, provided, however, that the Notice shall not contain the statement described in subparagraph (a)(1)(iv) of such section.

(c) Immediately upon completion of a final EIS, it shall be filed and made available for public inspection in the same manner as the draft EIS pursuant to § 6-11(b) of this chapter.






*§ 6-12 Agency Decision Making.*


(a) No final decision to carry out or approve an action which may have a significant effect on the environment shall be made until after the filing and consideration of a final EIS.

   (1) (Inapplicable, City Planning Rules, 62 RCNY § 5-02(a).)

   (2) (Inapplicable, City Planning Rules, 62 RCNY § 5-02(a).)

(b) When an agency decides to carry out or approve an action which may have a significant effect on the environment, it shall make the following findings in a written decision:

   (1) consistent with social, economic and other essential considerations of state and city policy, from among the reasonable alternatives thereto, the action to be carried out or approved is one which minimizes or avoids adverse environmental effects to the maximum extent possible, including the effects disclosed in the relevant environmental impact statement;

   (2) consistent with social, economic and other essential considerations of state and city policy, all practicable means will be taken in carrying out or approving the action to minimize or avoid adverse environmental effects.

(c) For public information purposes, the Decision shall be filed in the same manner as the draft EIS pursuant to § 6-11(b) of this chapter.






*§ 6-13 Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements.*


(a) Whenever possible, agencies shall identify programs or categories of actions, particularly projects or plans which are wide in scope or implemented over a long time frame, which would most appropriately serve as the subject of a single EIS. Broad program statements, master or area wide statements, or statements for comprehensive plans are often appropriate to assess the environmental effects of the following:

   (1) a number of separate actions in a given geographic area;

   (2) a chain of contemplated actions;

   (3) separate actions having generic or common impacts;

   (4) programs or plans having wide application or restricting the range of future alternative policies or projects.

(b) No further EIS's need be prepared for actions which are included in a programmatic EIS prepared pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section. However:

   (1) a programmatic EIS shall be amended or supplemented to reflect impacts which are not addressed or adequately analyzed in the EIS as originally prepared; and

   (2) actions which significantly modify a plan or program which has been the subject of an EIS shall require a supplementary EIS;

   (3) programmatic EIS's requiring amendment and actions requiring supplementary EIS's pursuant to this section shall be processed in full compliance with the requirements of this chapter.






*§ 6-14 Rules and Regulations.*


(Inapplicable, City Planning Rules 62 RCNY § 5-02(a).)






*§ 6-15 Lists of Actions.*


(a) Type I.(See City Planning Rules 62 RCNY § 5-02(d).) Type I actions enumerated in § 617.12 of 6 NYCRR 617 are likely to, but will not necessarily, require the preparation of an EIS because they will in almost every instance significantly affect the environment. However, ministerial actions never require the preparation of an EIS except where such actions may directly affect a critical area or an historic resource enumerated in paragraphs (22) and (23), respectively, of subdivision (a) of § 617.12. In addition, for the purpose of defining paragraph (2) of said subdivision and section, the following thresholds shall apply:

   (1) relating to public institutions:

      (i) new correction or detention centers with an inmate capacity of at least 200 inmates;

      (ii) new sanitation facilities, including:

         (A) incinerators of at least 250 tons per day capacity;

         (B) garages with a capacity of more than 50 vehicles;

         (C) marine transfer stations;

      (iii) new hospital or health related facilities containing at least 100,000 sq. ft. of floor area;

      (iv) new schools with seating capacity of at least 1,500 seats;

      (v) any new community or public facility not otherwise specified herein, containing at least 100,000 sq. ft. of floor area, or the expansion of an existing facility by more than 50 percent of size or capacity, where the total size of an expanded facility exceeds 100,000 sq. ft. of floor area.

   (2) relating to major office centers: any new office structure which has a minimum of 200,000 sq. ft. of floor area and exceeds permitted floor area under existing zoning by more than 20 percent, or the expansion of an existing facility by more than 50 percent of floor area, where the total size of an expanded facility exceeds 240,000 sq. ft. of floor area.

(b) Type II.

   (1) (See City Planning Rules 62 RCNY § 5-02(d).) Type II actions will never require the preparation of an EIS because they are determined not to have a significant effect on the environment, except where such actions may directly affect a critical area or an historic resource enumerated in paragraphs (22) and (23), respectively, of subdivision (a) of § 617.12 of 6 NYCRR 617.

   (2) (Inapplicable. Replaced by State Type II list 6 NYCRR Part 617.13. See City Planning Rules 62 RCNY § 5-02(a) and 62 RCNY § 5-02(b)(2).)






Chapter 6: Rules For the Processing of Plans Pursuant To Charter Section 197-a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 6-01 Purpose and Authority.*


(a) Authority. These rules of procedure and minimum standards are established for the review of plans for the development, growth and improvement of the city, its boroughs and communities. Such plans may be sponsored by the Mayor, the City Planning Commission (the "Commission"), the Department of City Planning (the "Department"), and any Borough President, borough board or community board, (which agencies shall be referred to as the "sponsor" herein) pursuant to § 197-a(b) of the New York City Charter.

(b) Policy Guidance. An adopted plan shall serve as a policy to guide subsequent actions by city agencies. The Commission shall consider pertinent such consideration as is consistent with the City Charter and general law. Agencies are urged to consider adopted 197-a plans as guidance for pertinent actions, whether or not such actions are subject to Commission review. The existence of an adopted 197-a plan shall not preclude the sponsor or any other city agency from developing other plans or taking actions not contemplated by the 197-a plan that may affect the same geographic area or subject matter.






*§ 6-02 Plan Submission.*


(a) Notification of Intent. To assist the Department in anticipating the need for technical assistance for the preparation of plans in the efficient scheduling of their review, the sponsor of a plan shall notify the Department of its intent to prepare and submit a plan. This notice shall be given not less than ninety (90) days prior to the submission of a proposed plan. Periodically, the Department shall report to the Commission on the notices received and on the progress of 197-a plans underway.

(b) Submission. All proposed plans shall be submitted to the Department of City Planning through its website or at 120 Broadway, 31st Floor, New York, NY 10271. If a plan has been initiated by a community board, borough board or Borough President, this initial submission shall include a summary record of the public hearing held by the board or Borough President. The submission shall also include the name(s) and address(es) of the person(s) designated by the sponsor to be its representative(s) in any discussions of the plan.








*§ 6-03 Threshold Review and Determination.*


(a) Department Review. Each proposed plan shall be reviewed by the Department staff who shall report to the Commission not later than 90 days after the plan's submission as to whether the plan appears to meet the standards for form and content and for consistency with sound planning, as set forth in 62 RCNY § 6-04. Prior to making the report, the staff shall inform the sponsor of all deficiencies with respect to form and content and any changes, additions or deletions which, in the opinion of the staff, may correct such deficiencies. The sponsor may, thereupon, indicate its willingness to make such changes, additions or deletions in which case the Department will defer its report to the Commission until the changes have been made. The sponsor may, instead, request that the plan be presented without change to the Commission for its threshold findings of form and content and sound planning policy. At the time of any Department report on a proposed plan, the Commission may receive a similar report from representatives of the sponsor.

(b) City Planning Commission Determination. Within 30 days after its presentation by the Department staff, the Commission shall determine, when required by the Charter and in accordance with the standards set forth in 63 RCNY § 6-04, whether the proposed plan is of appropriate form and sufficient content, and whether it is in accordance with sound planning policy. If the Commission has determined that a proposed plan does not meet the standards for form or content or for sound planning policy, it shall direct the plan back to the sponsor with a statement explaining its deficiencies. When the Commission has determined that a proposed plan is of appropriate form and content and is in accordance with sound planning policy, it shall direct the Department to undertake the necessary environmental review if the plan has been sponsored by a community board in accordance with 62 RCNY Chapter 5. If the plan has been sponsored by an agency other than a community board the Commission shall determine whether a Type II declaration, a negative declaration, or a notice of completion of a draft EIS has been issued, and if so, it shall direct the Department to distribute the plan in accordance with 62 RCMU § 6-06.

(c) Coordination of Plan Review. The Commission may determine that, despite its finding of appropriate form and content and sound planning policy, a proposed plan should not immediately proceed because there are other planning efforts, ULURP reviews or environmental studies underway which should be coordinated with the plan. In such a case, the Commission may direct the Department to work with the sponsor and any other interested agencies in developing an appropriate timetable and strategy for the plan, and to report back to the Commission.

(d) Progress Report. When 180 days has elapsed following a threshold determination pursuant to subdivision (b), if a proposed plan has not been distributed for review either because the environmental review remains incomplete, or because the plan has been delayed pursuant to subdivision (c), the sponsoring agency may make a written request to the Commission to expedite the plan's distribution. The Commission shall direct the Department to report in writing within a fixed period of time the progress of the plan, including any outstanding aspects of the environmental review, or any continuing problems of coordination delaying its review. Upon receipt of the report, the Commission may direct the Department to complete the review within a reasonable period of time.








*§ 6-04 Standards.*


(a) Plan Form and Content. The form and content of all proposed plans shall be consistent with the following:

   (1) A plan may take the form of a comprehensive or master plan for a neighborhood, community district, borough or other broad geographic area of the city. Such a plan would combine elements related to housing, industrial and commercial uses, transportation, land use regulation, open space, recreation, community facilities and other infrastructure and service improvements which promote the orderly growth, improvement and future development of the community, borough or city.

   (2) A plan may take the form of a targeted plan which considers one or a small number of elements of neighborhood, community districts, borough or citywide problems or needs. Such a plan shall have as its focus issues that are related to the use, development and improvement of land within the sponsor's geographic jurisdiction and may give consideration to the provision of various city services necessary to support orderly growth, development and improvement of that area.

   (3) A plan shall not be limited to a single zoning lot or a specific parcel in private ownership. A plan shall cover an identifiable, cohesive geographic area or neighborhood.

   (4) Plans shall be presented in clear language and coherent form with elements, chapters or sections that are organized in logical sequence.

   (5) Plans shall state their goals, objectives or purposes clearly and succinctly. Policy statements or recommendations shall contain documentation and explanation of the data, analysis or rationale underlying each. Plans shall demonstrate a serious attempt to analyze and propose policies that address the problems they identify.

   (6) A plan shall contain, as appropriate, inventories or description and analysis of existing conditions, problems or needs; projections of future conditions, problems or needs; and recommended goals and strategies to address those conditions, problems or needs. The level of detail and analysis shall be appropriate to the goals and recommendations presented in the plan. The information and analysis relied upon to support its recommendations shall be sufficiently identified so that when the plan is later under review, the accuracy and validity of the information and analysis may be understood. Supporting information may be contained in the form of narrative, maps, charts, tables, technical appendices or the like.

   (7) Plans shall be accompanied by documentation of the public participation in their formulation and preparation, such as workshops, hearings or technical advisory committees.

(b) Sound Planning Policy. 

   (1) All plans, no matter what their form and content, shall include discussion of their long-range consequences, their impact on economic and housing opportunity for all persons (particularly those of low and moderate income), their provision of future growth and development opportunities, their ability to improve the physical environment and their effect on the fair geographic distribution of city facilities. In determining whether a proposed plan contains sufficient discussion of these issues, the Commission shall not evaluate the merits of the plan.

   (2) A plan shall set forth goals, objectives, purposes, policies or recommendations that are within the legal authority of the city to undertake.

   (3) A plan which considers issues which are under the jurisdiction of specific city or state agencies shall contain evidence that such agencies have been consulted and shall disclose any comments of such agencies.

   (4) A plan shall show consideration of its relationship to applicable policy documents including the Ten Year Capital Strategy, the Zoning and Planning report, the borough and mayoral Strategic Policy Statements and any 197-a plan of a neighboring or superior jurisdiction.






*§ 6-05 Environmental Review.*


(a) Lead Agency. The City Planning Commission shall be the lead agency for all 197-a plans in accordance with the City Environmental Quality Review Regulations. For a plan sponsored by the mayor, the Commission may transfer the lead status to another city agency if it determines that the proposed plan is part of a broader set of actions for which the sponsoring agency is principally responsible.

(b) Community Board Plans The Department of City Planning, together with the Office of Environmental Coordination, shall conduct or cause to be conducted the required environmental review of any plan submitted by a community board.

(c) Other Agency Plans. The Department, on behalf of the Commission as lead agency, shall determine in consultation with any sponsor of a proposed plan which is not a community board, the appropriate scheduling and division of responsibilities for environmental review.






*§ 6-06 Plan Distribution and Review.*


(a) Plan Distribution. When pursuant to 62 RCNY § 6-03(b), the Commission directs the Department to distribute a proposed plan, the Department shall transmit the plan simultaneously to all affected community boards, Borough Presidents and borough boards, as defined in Charter §§ 196 and 197-a(c). The Commission may also direct its distribution to other agencies whose interests may be affected including neighboring community boards and Borough Presidents, and any city and state agency with jurisdiction over elements of the plan.

(b) Community Board Review. Each community board which has received from the Department of City Planning a proposed plan affecting land in its district shall conduct a public hearing on the plan except when a single borough-wide hearing is to be held on a borough plan. Notice of the public hearing shall be given and the hearing conducted in accordance with the ULURP rules for community board public hearings. Subsequent to the public hearing and within a period of sixty (60) days following its receipt of the plan, the community board shall transmit its written recommendation to the City Planning Commission with copies to the Borough President, City Council and the sponsor. The Community board which is the sponsor of a plan and which held a hearing on it prior to filing with the Department, need not hold a second hearing.

(c) Borough president review. The Borough President shall have one hundred twenty (120) days following the receipt of a proposed plan in which to review the plan and submit written recommendation to the City Planning Commission with copies to the City Council and sponsor. The Borough President may choose to conduct a public hearing on the plan.

(d) Borough board review. Each borough board which has received from the Department of City Planning a proposed plan affecting land in two or more community districts in its borough shall conduct a public hearing on the plan. Such public hearing shall take place and the report of the borough board shall be transmitted within one hundred twenty (120) days following its receipt of the plan. In the case of a plan affecting the entire borough, a single borough-wide public hearing may be held in lieu of separate hearings by the community boards. Notice of the public hearing shall be given and the hearing conducted in accordance with the ULURP rules governing borough board hearings. The borough board shall transmit its written recommendation to the City Planning Commission with copies to the City Council and the sponsor.

(e) Request for review. Any community board or borough board may make a written request to the Department to receive and review a proposed plan which does not involve land within its district or borough. In its request the Community board or borough board shall state the reason why the plan significantly affects the welfare of its district or borough. Upon receipt of the plan, the community board or borough board may conduct a public hearing and may make any recommendation to the City Planning Commission with copies to the City Council and sponsor. When it transmits such a plan, the Department shall notify the community board or borough board of the remaining time period during which it may review and comment on the plan.

(f) Other requests. A borough president may make a written request to the Department to receive and review a proposed plan for a district or area outside the borough. Any other interested party may similarly request a copy. Such request may be made to either the Department or the sponsor.








*§ 6-07 City Planning Commission Review.*


(a) Schedule for Review. When the affected community board(s), Borough President(s) and/or borough boards shall have completed their review of any proposed plan involving land in their respective districts, the City Planning Commission shall commence its review and schedule a public hearing. Such hearing shall take place within a period of sixty (60) days following receipt of the last affected community board's, borough board's or Borough President's recommendation, or the final day of the time period provided for their respective review(s), whichever is earlier.

(b) Public hearing. Notice of the public hearing shall be given and the hearing conducted in accordance with the ULURP rules governing Commission hearings.

(c) Commission resolution. The Commission shall vote by resolution to approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the plan. Such vote shall be taken within 60 days following the public hearing; however, if the Commission finds that it is unable to vote within that time period it shall give a written statement of explanation to the sponsor. In its review of the substance of the plan, the Commission shall give consideration to the community, borough and citywide impacts and to the long-term efforts that could result from the actions or policies recommended by the plan. It shall consider the impact of the plan on economic and housing opportunity, on future growth and development, and on the physical environment. Such consideration shall include the consistency of the plan with other Charter-defined plans and reports such as the mayoral and borough Strategic Policy Statements, the Ten-Year Capital Strategy, the Report on Social Indicators, the Zoning and Planning Report, and any other pertinent adopted 197-a plans. It shall also consider the fair share criteria adopted pursuant to § 203 of the City Charter in weighing any recommendation with respect to proposed city facilities.

(d) Commission Report. The Commission shall accompany its resolution with a report which sets forth its considerations and any explanation for its determination. The report may identify any environmental issues which may arise in conjunction with any actions recommended by the Plan, it may set forth proposals for additional study and consideration that the Commission deems necessary to carry out any recommendations made by the plan and it may include recommendations for the implementation of plan elements. The report and resolution shall be transmitted to the Mayor, the affected community board(s) and Borough President(s), the City Council and the sponsor.






*§ 6-08 Modifications.*


(a) If the City Council, acting pursuant to the City Charter § 197-d(d) has transmitted to the Commission a proposed modification of a plan, the Commission shall, within fifteen (15) days, review the proposed modification and transmit back to the Council its findings and recommendations. In determining whether the modification must be subject to additional environmental review, the Commission may consult appropriate staff or the Office of Environmental Coordination, and it must consult the lead agency if the lead has not been the Commission itself. In determining whether the modification requires a new process of community, borough and Commission review, the Commission shall consider whether the proposed modification:

   (1) would incorporate new elements* that were not a part of and are not related to the plan as it was previously reviewed.

   (2) would delete entire elements or remove from the plan consideration of significant long-range consequences, impacts on economic and housing opportunity for all persons, provision of future opportunities for growth and development, ability to improve the physical environment, or effects on the fair geographic distribution of city facilities.






*§ 6-09 Filing, Review and Revision.*


(a) Filing. Upon final adoption of a plan by the City Council, the plan shall be filed and indexed by the Calendar Officer of the Department. The Department shall make the plan available for review by the public and shall transmit the plan to all affected agencies for their use.

(b) Revision of Plans. A plan may be periodically reviewed and revised by its sponsor or the Commission may initiate such review. Any such revision may be presented for adoption as an amendment to the plan in accordance with the procedures set forth in these rules.

(c) Summary of Plans. In each Zoning and Planning Report adopted pursuant to Charter § 192(b), the Commission shall include a summary of all 197-a plans adopted during the preceding four years.

(a) Filing. Following notification pursuant to 62 RCNY § 8-02(a)(ii) that a draft application is complete, the applicant shall file the application pursuant to 62 RCNY § 10-09 with the Department of City Planning. Applications which have not been reviewed and determined to be complete pursuant to 62 RCNY § 8-02 shall not be accepted for filing. The Department may not consider the application as filed unless it includes all required components and shall not consider the application as filed unless the required fee has been paid concurrently with the submission of the application. Applications accepted for filing in accordance herewith shall be stamped by the Department with the date and time of filing.








*§ 8-04 Certification for Permitted Parking Spaces.*


(a) Filing Date. Review of applications for certification for permitted parking spaces shall be made, in accordance with the provisions of ZR § 93-82, in the order of application filing date and time, except as provided in paragraph (b) hereof. If, pursuant to ZR § 93-82, fewer permitted parking spaces are available than the number of spaces requested in an application, the Chairperson shall only grant a certification for the number of spaces as are available at the time, and shall issue subsequent certifications for such application at such time as additional spaces become available in accordance with ZR § 93-82. Except as provided in paragraph (b) below, certification of parking spaces shall not be made with respect to an application with a later filing date and time until the entire number of parking spaces requested in an application with an earlier filing date and time has been certified.

(b) Applicant Reduces Existing Spaces On Site. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), if an applicant intends to eliminate existing parking spaces at the site that is the subject of the application, a certification for permitted parking spaces may be granted to the extent that elimination of existing parking spaces allows such determination to be made pursuant to ZR § 93-821 (e)(1) and (2), provided: (i) that such existing parking spaces shall be eliminated prior to issuance of the certification. The elimination of such existing parking spaces shall be evidenced by: (aa) an acknowledgement from the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs that license(s) issued by such agency for the operation of public parking at the site have been surrendered or, if such license(s) are pending renewal at the time, that the licensee has stated to the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs in writing that the license(s) will not be renewed; or (bb) if the licensee is no longer in control of the premises, in the form of an affidavit from the owner or applicant attesting to the fact that the licensee is not in control of the premises and is not authorized to operate at the premises; and (ii) a restrictive declaration executed by all parties-in-interest, as such term is defined in ZR § 12-10, providing that any resumption of use of the eliminated spaces prior to or during construction shall be prohibited, has been recorded in the office of the City Register. If the number of parking spaces requested in the application exceeds the number of permitted spaces available by reason of the elimination of existing spaces, any subsequent certifications with respect to additional spaces shall be made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) above.

*§ 9-01 Purpose.*


These rules of procedure are established for the review of applications for Certification to Allow a Limited Increase in Street Wall Width pursuant to § 132-51 of the Zoning Resolution (ZR).






*§ 9-02 Pre-Filing Process.*


(a) The applicant must submit for review a draft application which must include material required by the Department of City Planning ("the Department") demonstrating the information and items set forth in ZR § 132-51. Draft applications must be submitted to the specific division of the Department that is designated on the application form for receipt of an application filed pursuant to ZR § 132-51, by submission to the division so named on the application form at the New York City Department of City Planning. Upon receipt, the Department will record the date and time of receipt.

(b) The Department will review each draft application for accuracy and completeness in order of receipt. The Department will notify the applicant in order of receipt whether the draft application is complete and may be filed in accordance with the provisions of 62 RCNY § 9-03, or whether the draft application is incomplete and requires revision. Such notification will be provided via the delivery method identified by the applicant on the application form, and will include a specification of the portions of the application that are incorrect or incomplete and require revision, if applicable.

(c) The Department will record the date and time of receipt of any revised draft application submitted in response to a notification provided under subdivision (b) of this section. A revised draft application will be reviewed for completeness and the applicant will be notified of the Department's further determination in order of receipt of the revised draft application. Such notification of the Department's further determination will be provided pursuant to the procedure set forth in subdivision (b) of this section.








*§ 9-03 Filing of Applications.*


Filing. Following notification pursuant to 62 RCNY § 9-02(b) or (c) that a draft application is complete, the applicant must file the application pursuant to 62 RCNY § 10-09 with the Department of City Planning. Applications that have not been reviewed and determined to be complete pursuant to 62 RCNY § 9-02 will not be accepted for filing.

For applications for establishments within the same set of applicable geographic boundaries as set forth in ZR § 132-51(c), review and certification of applications will be made in the order of application filing date and time. As set forth in ZR § 132-51(c), the set of applicable geographic boundaries means the same block frontage containing the applicant's establishment, the block frontage directly across the street from the block containing such establishment, and the blocks fronting on the commercial street immediately adjacent to the north and south of the block containing the applicant's establishment.






*§ 9-05 Lapse of Certification.*


(a) Effect of Lapse. If a certification granted pursuant to ZR § 132-51 lapses in accordance with the provisions set forth in the final paragraph of that section, or if an authorization granted pursuant to ZR § 132-52 lapses in accordance with the provisions set forth in ZR § 11-42, the effect of such lapse is that the underlying application for such certification or authorization will not be considered an "approved application" for purposes of ZR § 132-51(c)(2).

(b) Substantial Construction. For purposes of ZR § 132-51, the term "substantial construction" means that the entirety of the interior space associated with the extension pursuant to the certification has been combined, has been made a part of the operations of the enlarged establishment, and remains open to customers from any and all doorways located along the approved retail frontage, except that entrances serving portions of the establishment reserved for employees only do not need to be open to customers.

APPENDIX A TO TITLE 62: CRITERIA FOR THE LOCATION OF CITY FACILITIES*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*Preface*


These criteria are intended to guide the siting of city facilities, as provided by Section 203 of the City Charter. The fair distribution of city facilities will depend on balancing a number of factors, such as community needs for services, efficient and cost effective delivery of those services, effects on community stability and revitalization, and broad geographic distribution of facilities. Furthermore, these factors can be weighed more effectively, and siting decisions can be accepted more readily, when communities have been meaningfully informed and consulted early in the siting process. The intent of these guidelines is to improve, not to obstruct, the process of siting facilities.

Under the provisions of Section 204 of the Charter, the Mayor will prepare an annual Statement of Needs in accordance with these criteria. The Statement of Needs will provide early notice of facility proposals to Borough Presidents, Community Boards, and the public at large. It will be accompanied by a map and text indicating the location and current use of all city properties and of state and federal facilities, as designated by the Charter. This will allow the public and city agencies to assess the existing distribution of facilities and analyze factors of compatibility and concentration. Section 204 also provides procedures for public review and comment on the Statement of Needs, permits Borough Presidents to propose locations for city facilities, and requires city agencies to consider the statements that ensue from that review. Those provisions, together with these criteria, should provide a more open and systematic process for the consideration of facility sites.

The criteria will have several applications in the Section 204 proceedings. The Mayor and city agencies will use them in formulating plans for facilities. Community Boards will refer to them in commenting on the Statement of Needs, and Borough Presidents will employ them in recommending specific sites for facilities. The City Planning Commission will consider them in acting on site selection and acquisition proposals subject to the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) and in the review of city office sites pursuant to Section 195 of the Charter. Sponsoring agencies will also observe them in actions that do not proceed through ULURP such as city contracts, facility reductions, and closings. Although recognizing that non-city agencies are not subject to these criteria, the Commission encourages all such agencies to consider the factors identified in these criteria when they are siting facilities in this city.

Since the principles and procedures contained in these guidelines are new and untested, it is important to monitor and evaluate their effects. The Department of City Planning will undertake this evaluation and report its findings to the Commission and the Mayor within twenty-four months of adoption and periodically thereafter.






*Article 1 Authority.*


Pursuant to Section 203 of the New York City Charter, the City Planning Commission is authorized to establish criteria for the location of new city facilities, the significant expansion of existing facilities, and the closing or significant reduction in size or service capacity of existing facilities.






*Article 2 Purpose and Goals.*


The purpose of these criteria is to foster neighborhood stability and revitalization by furthering the fair distribution among communities of city facilities. Toward this end, the city shall seek to:

a) Site facilities equitably by balancing the considerations of community needs for services, efficient and cost-effective service delivery, and the social, economic, and environmental impacts of city facilities upon surrounding areas;

b) Base its siting and service allocation proposals on the city's long-range policies and strategies, sound planning, zoning, budgetary principles, and local and citywide land use and service delivery plans;

c) Expand public participation by creating an open and systematic planning process in which communities are fully informed, early in the process, of the city's specific criteria for determining the need for a given facility and its proposed location, the consequences of not taking the proposed action, and the alternatives for satisfying the identified need;

d) Foster consensus building to avoid undue delay or conflict in siting facilities providing essential city services;

e) Plan for the fair distribution among communities of facilities providing local or neighborhood services in accordance with relative needs among communities for those services;

f) Lessen disparities among communities in the level of responsibility each bears for facilities serving citywide or regional needs;

g) Preserve the social fabric of the city's diverse neighborhoods by avoiding undue concentrations of institutional uses in residential areas; and

h) Promote government accountability by fully considering all potential negative effects, mitigating them as much as possible, and monitoring neighborhood impacts of facilities once they are built.






*Article 3 Definitions.*


For purposes of these rules, the following definitions apply.

a) City facility: A facility providing city services whose location, expansion, closing or reduction in size is subject to control and supervision by a city agency, and which is:

   (i) operated by the city on property owned or leased by the city which is greater than 750 square feet in total floor area; or

   (ii) used primarily for a program or programs operated pursuant to a written agreement on behalf of the city which derives at least 50 percent and at least $50,000 of its annual funding from the city.

b) New facility: A city facility newly established as a result of an acquisition, lease, construction, or contractual action or the substantial change in use of an existing facility.

c) Residential facility: A city facility with sleeping accommodations which provides temporary or transitional housing, provides for pre-trial detention or custody of sentenced inmates, or provides a significant amount of on-site support services for residents with special needs for supervision, care, or treatment.

d) Local or neighborhood facility: A city facility serving an area no larger than a community district or local service delivery district (pursuant to Section 2704 of the Charter), in which the majority of persons served by the facility live or work (see Attachment A).

e) Regional or citywide facility: A facility which serves two or more community districts or local service delivery districts, an entire borough, or the city as a whole and which may be located in any of several different areas consistent with the specific criteria for that facility as described in the Citywide Statement of Needs pursuant to Section 204 of the Charter (see Attachment B).

f) Significant expansion: An addition of real property by purchase, lease or interagency transfer, or construction of an enlargement, which would expand the lot area, floor area or capacity of a city facility by 25 percent or more and by at least 500 square feet. An expansion of less that 25 percent shall be deemed significant if it, together with expansions made in the prior three-year period, would expand the facility by 25 percent or more and by at least 500 square feet.

g) Significant reduction: A surrender or discontinuance of the use of real property that would reduce the size or capacity to deliver service of a city facility by 25 percent or more. A reduction of less than 25 percent shall be deemed significant if it, together with reductions made in the prior three-year period, would reduce the facility by 25 percent or more.






*Article 4 Criteria for Siting or Expanding Facilities.*


The following criteria and procedures apply to the siting of all new facilities other than administrative offices and data processing facilities ar.d the significant expansion of such facilities.

4.1 The sponsoring agency and, for actions subject to the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) or review pursuant to Section 195 of the Charter, the City Planning Commission, shall consider the following criteria:

a) Compatibility of the facility with existing facilities and programs, both city and non-city, in the immediate vicinity of the site.

b) Extent to which neighborhood character would be adversely affected by a concentration of city and/or non-city facilities.

c) Suitability of the site to provide cost-effective delivery of the intended services. Consideration of sites shall include properties not under city ownership, unless the agency provides a written explanation of why it is not reasonable to do so in this instance.

d) Consistency with the locational and other specific criteria for the facility identified in the Statement of Needs or, if the facility is not listed in the Statement, in a subsequent submission to a Borough President.

e) Consistency with any plan adopted pursuant to Section 197-a of the Charter.

4.2Procedures for Consultation. In formulating its facility proposals, the sponsoring agency shall:

a) Consider the Mayor's and Borough President's stategic policy statements, the Community Board's Statement of District Needs and Budget Priorities, and any published Department of City Planning land use plan for the area.

b) Consider any comments received from the Community Boards or Borough Presidents and any alternative sites proposed by a Borough President pusuant to Section 204(f) of the Charter, as well as any comments or recommendations received in any meetings, consultations or communications with the Community Boards or Borough Presidents. If the Statement of Needs has identified the community district where a proposed facility would be sited, then, upon the written request of the affected Community Board, the sponsoring agency should attend the Board's hearing on the Statement. If the community district is later identified, then the sponsoring agency shall at that point notify the Community Board and offer to meet with the board or its designee to discuss the proposed program.






*Article 5 Criteria for Siting or Expanding Local/Neighborhood Facilities.*


In addition to the criteria and procedures stated in Article 4, the following criteria and procedures apply to the siting of new local or neighborhood facilities other than administrative offices and data processing facilities, and the significant expansion of such facilities (see Attachment A).

5.1 The sponsoring agency and, for actions subject to ULURP or review pursuant to Section 195 of the Charter, the City Planning Commission, shall consider the following criteria:

a) Need for the facility or expansion in the community or local service delivery district. The sponsoring agency should prepare an analysis which identifies the conditions or characteristics that indicate need within a local area (e.g., infant mortality rates, facility utilization rates, emergency response time, parkland/population ratios) and which assesses relative needs among communities for the service provided by the facility. New or expanded facilities should, wherever possible, be located in areas with low ratios of service supply to service demand.

b) Accessibility of the site to those it is intended to serve.

5.2 A Community Board may choose to designate or establish a committee to monitor selected local facilities after siting approval pursuant to these criteria. Following site selection and approval for such a facility, the sponsoring agency and Community Board shall jointly establish a mutually acceptable procedure by which the agency periodically reports to the committee regarding the plans and procedures that may affect the compatibility of the facility with the surrounding community and responds to community concerns.






*Article 6 Criteria for Siting or Expanding Regional/Citywide Facilities.*


In addition to the criteria and procedures stated in Article 4, the following criteria and procedures apply to the siting of new regional and citywide facilities other than administrative offices and data processing facilities, and the significant expansion of such facilities (see Attachment B).

6.1 The sponsoring agency and, for actions subject to ULURP or review pursuant to Section 195 of the Charter, the City Planning Commission, shall consider the following criteria:

a) Need for the facility or expansion. Need shall be established in a citywide or borough-wide service plan or, as applicable, by inclusion in the city's ten-year capital strategy, four-year capital program, or other analyses of service needs.

b) Distribution of similar facilities throughout the city. To promote the fair geographic distribution of facilities, the sponsoring agency should examine the distribution among the boroughs of existing and proposed facilities, both city and non-city, that provide similar services, in addition to the availability of appropriately zoned sites.

c) Size of the facility. To lessen local impacts and increase broad distribution of facilities, the new facility or expansion should not exceed the minimum size necessary to achieve efficient and cost-effective delivery of services to meet existing and projected needs.

d) Adequacy of the streets and transit to handle the volume and frequency of traffic generated by the facility.

6.2 Where practicable, the Mayor may initiate and sponsor a consensus building process to determine the location of a proposed regional facility. A Borough President may submit a written request for such a process if the request is made within 90 days of publication of the Statement of Needs or, if the facility is not listed in the Statement, within 30 days of a subsequent submission to the Borough President.

In the consensus building process, representatives of affected interests will convene to assess potential sites in accordance with these criteria and the specific criteria set forth in the Statement of Needs. The participants may include but need not be limited to representatives of the Mayor, the sponsoring agency, the Borough President(s), and the affected Community Board(s). The participants may review any issue relevant to site selection under these criteria. The process shall be completed within a reasonable time period to be determined by the Mayor. If location of the facility is subject to ULURP, the process shall be completed prior to submission of a ULURP application. If the participants (including the sponsoring agency) reach consensus, the agency will submit whatever agreements were reached regarding the facility and site to the City Planning Commission as part of its ULURP application for the site. If no such consensus is reached, the sponsoring agency may initiate ULURP, if applicable, for its proposed site.

6.3 Upon the request of the Borough President and/or Community Board, a sponsoring agency and Community Board shall establish a facility monitoring committee, or designate an existing Community Board committee, to monitor a facility following selection and approval of its site. The agency shall inform the committee of plans and procedures that may affect the compatibility of the facility with the surrounding community. Once the facility is constructed, the sponsoring agency shall meet with the committee according to a schedule established by the committee and agency to report on the status of those plans and procedures and to respond to community concerns. The committee may also submit reports to the agency head addressing outstanding issues. The agency head shall respond to the committee's report within 45 days and shall identify the actions, if any, that the agency plans in response to such concerns.

6.4 Transportation and Waste Management Facilities. Transportation and waste management facilities (see Attachment B) are subject to the following criteria in addition to those stated in Article 4 and Sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3.

6.41 The proposed site should be optimally located to promote effective service delivery in that any alternative site actively considered by the sponsoring agency or identified pursuant to Section 204(f) of the Charter would add significantly to the cost of constructing or operating the facility or would significantly impair effective service delivery.

6.42 In order to avoid aggregate noise, odor, or air quality impacts on adjacent residential areas, the sponsoring agency and the City Planning Commission, in its review of the proposal, shall take into consideration the number and proximity of existing city and non-city facilities, situated within approximately a one-half mile radius of the proposed site, which have similar environmental impacts.

6.5 Residential Facilities. Regional or citywide residential facilities (see Attachment B) are subject to the following criteria in addition to those stated in Article 4 and Sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3.

6.51 Undue concentration or clustering of city and non-city facilities providing similar services or serving a similar population should be avoided in residential areas.

6.52 Necessary support services for the facility and its residents should be available or provided.

6.53 In community districts with a high ratio* of residential facility beds to population, the proposed siting shall be subject to the following additional considerations:

   a) Whether the facility, in combination with other similar city and non-city facilities within a defined area surrounding the site (approximately a half-mile radius, adjusted for significant physical boundaries), would have a significant cumulative negative impact on neighborhood character.

   b) Whether the site is well located for efficient service delivery.

   c) Whether any alternative sites actively considered by the sponsoring agency or identified pursuant to Section 204(f) of the Charter which are in community districts with lower ratios of residential facility beds to population than the citywide average would add significantly to the cost of constructing or operating the facility or would impair service delivery.

To facilitate this evaluation, the Department of City Planning will publish annually an index of the number of beds per thousand population, by type of residential facility (as set forth in Appendix C) and overall, in each community district. The index will be based upon the number of beds in all city, state, federal, and private facilities in operation or approved for operation.






*Article 7 Criteria for Siting or Expanding Administrative Offices and Data Processing Facilities.*


The following criteria apply to the siting of new city administrative offices and data processing facilities and the significant expansion of such facilities, pursuant to Section 195 of the City Charter.

7.1 The sponsoring agency and the City Planning Commission shall consider the following criteria:

a) Suitability of the site to provide cost-effective operations.

b) Suitability of the site for operational efficiency, taking into consideration its accessibility to staff, the public and/or other sectors of city government.

c) Consistency with the locational and other specific criteria for the facility stated in the Statement of Needs.

d) Whether the facility can be located so as to support development and revitalization of the city's regional business districts without constraining operational efficiency.






*Article 8 Criteria for Closing or Reducing Facilities.*


The following criteria and procedures apply to the closing of existing facilities and the significant reduction in size or capacity to deliver service of existing facilities.

8.1 The sponsoring agency shall consider the following criteria:

a) The extent to which the closing or reduction would create or significantly increase any existing imbalance among communities of service levels relative to need. Wherever possible, such actions should be proposed for areas with high ratios of service supply to service demand.

b) Consistency with the specific criteria for selecting the facility for closure or reduction as identified in the Statement of Needs.

8.2 In proposing facility closings or reductions, the sponsoring agency shall consult with the affected Community Board(s) and Borough President about the alternatives within the district or borough, if any, for achieving the planned reduction and the measures to be taken to ensure adequate levels of service.






*Article 9 Actions not Subject to the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure or Section 195.*


9.1 Whenever an agency takes an action with respect to a city facility that is subject to these criteria but is not subject to ULURP or to Charter Section 195 review, the agency shall submit a statement to the Mayor, with copies to the affected Community Board(s), Borough President, and Department of City Planning, which describes the agency's consideration and application of the relevant sections of these criteria, and states the reasons for any inconsistencies.
