A Commissioner of Deeds appointed in the City of New York may administer oaths and take acknowledgements or proofs of deeds and other documents in any part of the City of New York.

(b) Administering oaths and taking acknowledgement or proofs.

   (1) Oaths. For the purpose of a Commissioner of Deeds, an oath is a person's verbal pledge that her statements contained in a document are true. An affirmation is the equivalent of an oath and may be administered to anyone who objects to taking an oath as a matter of principle. Oaths and affirmations must be administered in legally acceptable forms. An acceptable form for administering an oath is: "Do you solemnly swear that the contents of the statement made and subscribed by you are true and correct?" An acceptable form for administering an affirmation is: "Do you solemnly, sincerely, and truly, declare and affirm that the statements made and subscribed by you are true and correct?" When an oath or affirmation is administered, the person swearing or affirming must express assent to the oath or affirmation by the words "I do" or words of like meaning. For an oath or affirmation to be valid, whatever form is used, it is necessary that:

      (i) the person swearing or affirming be personally present before the Commissioner of Deeds;

      (ii) the person unequivocally swears or affirms that what she states is true;

      (iii) the person swears or affirms as of that moment; and

      (iv) the person consciously and conscientiously takes upon herself the obligation of an oath or affirmation.

   (2) Proofs.

      (i) A proof is used in place of an acknowledgement on certain instruments. A proof is a formal declaration by a person who witnessed the signing of an instrument and who himself signed as a subscribing witness, which declaration sets forth:

         (A) the witness' place of residence;

         (B) that the witness knew the individual who is described in and who executed (signed) the instrument; and

         (C) that the witness actually saw the individual sign the instrument.

      (ii) As with acknowledgements, there is no prescribed form for taking a proof. For a proof to be valid, the commissioner of deeds must be satisfied that:

         (A) the witness is who she claims to be;

         (B) the witness is stating her correct place of residence;

         (C) the witness does in fact personally know the individual who executed the instrument; and

         (D) the witness actually saw the individual execute the instrument. When a proof is taken, the Commissioner of Deeds must place a statement on the document or attached thereto as evidence of her having taken the proof. Whatever form is used, the statement must recite all the matters that were required to be done, known, or proved on the taking of the proof, together with the name, place of residence, and substance of the declaration of the person giving proof. An acceptable form of the statement is: "On this ________________ day of __________,  19 ____, before me came (person's name), to me known to be the individual who subscribed as witness the foregoing instrument and declared that she resides at (house and street), (town or city), (state), that she knows personally (person's name), that she knows the person to be the individual described in and who executed the foregoing instrument, and that (the person) executed the foregoing instrument in her presence." This statement must be followed by the Commissioner's signature and other information described above.

   (3) Fee. The fee for administering an oath or taking an acknowledgement or proof is twenty-five cents.

(c) Authentication. "Authentication" in this case involves a County Clerk affirming the genuineness of a certificate of acknowledgement, proof, or oath taken before a Commissioner of Deeds. The significance of authentication is as follows: When an instrument or paper is sworn to, proved, or acknowledged before a Commissioner of Deeds within the City of New York, it can be recorded and read in evidence in any office of any County Clerk within the City of New York or in the Office of the Register of the City of New York without the need for further proof. However, for such an instrument to be read into evidence, without the need for further proof, anywhere in New York outside the five boroughs of the City, it is necessary that the instrument first be authenticated by one of the County Clerks in the City of New York. To permit people to have instruments authenticated, a Commissioner of Deeds may file his autograph signature and certificate of appointment in the office of any County Clerk in New York City. Certificates of appointment may be obtained from the Office of the City Clerk.






*§ 2-07 Restrictions.* ::


(a) A Commissioner of Deeds must be and remain a resident of New York City. If a Commissioner of Deeds ceases to be a New York City resident he vacates his office and must immediately notify the City Clerk.

(b) A Commissioner of Deeds appointed within the City of New York cannot perform official functions anywhere except within the five boroughs of the City of New York.

(c) A Commissioner cannot certify any document to a transaction in which the Commissioner has an interest (financial) or to which the Commissioner of Deeds is a party.

(d) A Commissioner of Deeds cannot charge a fee for administering oaths of office to: a member of the legislature; any military officer; an inspector of election; a clerk of the poll; or any other public officer or public employee.

(e) The powers of a Commissioner of Deeds are personal and cannot be delegated to anyone.

(f) A Commissioner of Deeds who is an employee or stockholder of a corporation may take the acknowledgement or proof of any party to a written instrument executed by the corporation, or may administer an oath to any other officer, employee, or stockholder of the corporation, except when the Commissioner of Deeds himself is one of the parties executing the instrument either as individual or as a representative of the corporation.

(g) A Commissioner of Deeds has no power to protest a negotiable instrument (e.g., a promissory note or bill of exchange).

(h) A Commissioner of Deeds cannot take an acknowledgement or proof of the execution of a will.






*§ 2-08 Professional Conduct.* ::


(a) General. A Commissioner of Deeds is a public officer, and is so regarded under the laws of the State of New York. As such, a high standard of professional conduct is required and expected of each individual having an appointment as a Commissioner of Deeds. Moreover, the care with which a Commissioner of Deeds performs her duties can often be the only thing that ensures the integrity of a particular document. In performing the functions of his or her office, a Commissioner of Deeds must:

   (1) take an acknowledgement or proof, or administer an oath, only when the individual is personally present (taking proofs or acknowledgements, or administering oaths, over the telephone or otherwise is absolutely illegal);

   (2) always satisfy himself as to the true identity of the individual giving the acknowledgement or taking an oath; and

   (3) always follow the appropriate forms when administering oaths, issuing certificates, etc. In addition to the prohibition against the careless performance of the duties of the office of Commissioner of Deeds, there are strict legal proscriptions against the deliberate abuse of the office:

(b) Official misconduct. A public servant is guilty of official misconduct when, with intent to obtain a benefit or to injure or deprive another person of a benefit:

   (1) he commits an act relating to his office but constituting an unauthorized exercise of his official functions, knowing that such act is unauthorized; or

   (2) he knowingly refrains from performing a duty which is imposed upon him by law or is clearly inherent in the nature of his office.

Official misconduct is a Class A misdemeanor.

(NYS Penal Law § 195.00.)

(c) Issuing a false certificate. (Falsely stating that someone took an oath or gave an acknowledgement of proof.) A person is guilty of issuing a false certificate when, being a public servant authorized by law to make or issue official certificates or other official written instruments, and with intent to defraud, deceive or injure another person, he issues such an instrument, or makes the same with intent that it be issued, knowing that it contains a false statement or false information.

Issuing a false certificate is a Class E felony.

(NYS Penal Law § 175.40.)

(d) Forgery in the second degree. A person is guilty of forgery in the second degree when, with intent to defraud, deceive, or injure another, he falsely makes, completes or alters a written instrument which is or purports to be, or which is calculated to become or to represent if completed:

   (1) a deed, will codicil, contract, assignment, commercial instrument, or other instrument which does or may evidence, create, transfer, terminate or otherwise effect a legal right, interest, obligation or status; or

   (2) a public record, or an instrument filed or required or authorized by law to be filed in or with a public office or public servant; or

   (3) a written instrument officially issued or created by a public office, public servant or governmental instrumentality.

Forgery in the second degree is a Class D felony.

(NYS Penal Law § 170.10.)

(e) Fees. A public officer or other person who charges a fee for his service which is greater than the amount allowed by statute, or which charges a fee for services that were not actually rendered, is liable, in addition to the punishment prescribed by law for the criminal offense, to an action on behalf of the person aggrieved, in which the plaintiff is entitled to treble damages. (Outline of NYS Pub. Off. Law §§ 67(2), (3), (4).)

(f) Fraud in office. A Commissioner of Deeds who, in the exercise of the powers, or in the performance of the duties of such office, shall practice any fraud or deceit, the punishment for which is not otherwise provided for by this act, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. (NYS Exec. Law § 135-a(2).)

(g) Acting without authority. Anyone who holds himself out to the public as being entitled to act as a Commissioner of Deeds or conveys the impression that he is a Commissioner of Deeds, without having been appointed a Commissioner of Deeds, is guilty of a misdemeanor. (NYS Exec. Law § 135-a(1).)

(h) Penalties. In addition to the criminal and civil penalties outlined above, any kind of misconduct in office by a Commissioner of Deeds is punishable by removal from office. Section 140 of the New York State Executive Law vests the Office of the Mayor with the power to remove a Commissioner of Deeds from office for cause shown. Commissioners have the right to answer charges brought against them. (NYS Exec. Law § 140(12).) Removal from office as a Commissioner of Deeds of the City of New York disqualifies an individual from ever again being appointed to that office. In addition, that individual is disqualified from becoming a Notary Public. Anyone removed from office as a Commissioner of Deeds who, after learning of such removal, continues to perform the functions of that office, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.




Chapter 3: Marriages
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 3-01 Marriage License Application Forms.* ::


(a) Both parties must be present in order to obtain a blank marriage license application. The prospective bride and prospective groom must fill out the application in the City Clerk's office and present it for processing.

(b) Under no circumstances shall a clerk give out a blank application for a marriage license unless both the prospective bride and prospective groom are personally present before that clerk, except that where, for religious or health reasons or, in the sole discretion of the City Clerk, by reason of other exigent circumstances, both parties to the marriage cannot be present at the same time, the City Clerk may waive the requirement imposed by subdivision (a) of this section.

(c) The foregoing do not apply to cases where City Clerk personnel must issue a marriage license in a prison or a hospital or where the parties have submitted the application for a marriage license by electronic means.






*§ 3-02 Issuing Licenses Outside of the Office.* ::


Marriage licenses may be issued only at the Marriage Bureau in the ordinary course of the business day. There are only two exceptions to this section: cases where an individual is confined to a hospital, and cases where an individual is confined in prison. Such issuance is strictly a courtesy, and is therefore entirely subject to the availability of personnel and the schedule of the office.

(a) In a hospital case, there are three requirements that must be met before a license may be issued:

   (1) the parties must present a statement from the doctor indicating that the sick party is seriously ill, that he or she will be confined to the hospital for a very long period of time, that there is a possibility that the sick person will not survive the illness, and that the sick person is mentally competent to apply for the marriage license; and

   (2) the parties must call ahead of time or make arrangements for the license to be issued; and

   (3) the parties must be willing to furnish our clerk with transportation to and from the hospital, and must arrange on their own for someone to return to the office to pick up the marriage license after it has been prepared.

(b) In a prison case, the requirements are as follows:

   (1) the parties must present a written statement from the social worker, warden, or other authorized person granting consent for the issuing of the marriage license in the prison; and

   (2) the parties must contact the office ahead of time to request the license to be issued and to make all necessary preparations.






*§ 3-03 Hearings Pursuant to Domestic Relations Law § 15.* ::


(a)  Production of witnesses or notarized affidavits to establish identity. If in the opinion of the issuing clerk there appears to be some question as to the identity of one or both of the parties, the City Clerk, pursuant to the provisions of § 15 of the New York State Domestic Relations Law, may compel the production of witnesses, certified official records or notarized affidavits to establish the identity of the parties.

(b) Request for review of City Clerk's preliminary denial of marriage license.

   (1) Applicants who have been preliminarily denied a marriage license by the City Clerk may request a review of such determination by paying a $25 fee and filing a request for a review on such form as may be provided by the City Clerk no later than 30 days after such preliminary denial. The City Clerk may waive this fee upon a showing of financial hardship.

   (2) Duty of the City Clerk. Within fifteen days of receipt of a request for review the City Clerk shall forward to the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH) such request for review, a written statement outlining the reason for the preliminary denial of the marriage license and the documentary evidence supporting the preliminary denial, all of which documentation with the exception of the request for review shall constitute the petition. A copy of the petition shall be mailed contemporaneously to the applicant via certified mail return receipt requested.

   (3) Notice to spouse of record. Where the marriage license was denied because of the existence in the records of the City Clerk of a prior non-terminated marriage, the City Clerk shall exert its best efforts to notify the spouse of record of the impending action. The spouse of record shall be given twenty-one days from the date of mailing to respond to such notification. In such response, the spouse of record may request an opportunity to be heard on the issue, either in writing or at the hearing, if OATH decides a hearing is warranted. Upon request contained in such response, the City Clerk shall forward to the spouse of record all documentation exchanged among OATH, the City Clerk and the applicant.

   (4) Applicant's duty to respond. Applicant shall, no later than thirty days after he or she receives the petition, submit in duplicate an answer to the City Clerk including therein any documentary evidence or other proof which may include notarized affidavits in support of his or her claim. Upon written request of the applicant stating the specific reason for such request, submitted no later than five days prior to the due date for such answer, the City Clerk may for good cause grant an extension of time for applicant to submit the same. Upon receipt of the answer the City Clerk shall forward a copy thereof to OATH. Applicant's failure to respond by the deadline set forth herein, including any extension granted by the City Clerk pursuant to this sub-paragraph, shall be deemed a withdrawal of the applicant's challenge to the City Clerk's preliminary decision and such preliminary decision shall thereafter be deemed final.

   (5) Designation of OATH. Pursuant to Charter § 1048, the City Clerk designates OATH to conduct on its behalf all the reviews and hearings referred to herein.

   (6) The reviewing officer. An administrative law judge ("ALJ") employed by OATH shall review the petition and the answer no later than fifteen days after the date of receipt of both the petition and the answer as well as any documentation presented by the spouse of record, if any. If upon such review the ALJ shall conclude that such evidence is sufficient to form a conclusion then the ALJ shall prepare no later than thirty days after receipt of all of the documents referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph a report summarizing the evidence presented, an analysis of the legal and factual issues, recommended findings of fact and recommended disposition. Such report shall be sent to the City Clerk for a final determination of the facts and a final disposition. Alternatively, if the ALJ shall conclude that the evidence presented is insufficient to form a conclusion, the ALJ shall convene a hearing at a date to be determined in such ALJ's sole discretion but no later than sixty days from the date of such initial review. Upon notification thereof by such ALJ, which notification may be electronic, the City Clerk, not later than five days after the date of such notification, shall notify the applicant as well as his or her attorney or other representative, if any, and the spouse of record, if any, of the date of the hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested. Such notification shall be post-marked no later than thirty days prior to the date of such hearing.

It shall be the obligation of any party intending to present the testimony of expert witness or witnesses at the hearing to notify the ALJ and the opposing parties of such intention no later than fifteen days prior to the date of the hearing and to submit to both the ALJ and the opposing parties no later than seven days prior to the date of the hearing copies of any reports, filings or any other documentation produced by such expert witness or witnesses which such party intends to use at the hearing. The ALJ may grant an extension of time to the parties.

   (8) The hearing. The ALJ shall preside over the hearing, make all procedural rulings, and make a statement on the record describing the nature of the proceedings, the issues, and the manner in which the hearing will be conducted. The ALJ shall have all the requisite powers conferred by law to administer oaths, issue subpoenas, require the attendance of witnesses and production of records, rule upon requests for adjournment, rule upon evidentiary matters and to otherwise regulate the hearing, observe the requirements of due process and effectuate the purposes and provisions of applicable law. All testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation administered by the ALJ. The City Clerk shall have the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the applicant should not be granted a marriage license.

   (9) The applicant and the spouse of record, if any, may be represented by an attorney or other representative of his or her choice.

   (10) The applicant as well as the City Clerk and the spouse of record, if any, may have witnesses, may give testimony and may otherwise present relevant and material evidence on his or her behalf, may cross-examine witnesses and may examine any document or other item offered into evidence.

   (11) A recorded copy of the record of the hearing shall be prepared by OATH; upon request a compact disc audio recording of the hearing, at no cost, or a transcript of the hearing, at a cost to be determined by OATH, may be provided.

   (12) At the discretion of the ALJ, the hearing may be adjourned for good cause upon the request of any of the parties or upon the ALJ's own motion and with notice to the parties.

   (13) The hearing shall be conducted in conformity with procedural requirements of applicable law and the rules of procedure adopted by OATH which are not inconsistent with these rules. In the event of any conflict of laws, the rules of this section shall be determinative and controlling.

   (14) After the conclusion of the hearing, the ALJ shall prepare a report summarizing the evidence presented, an analysis of the legal and factual issues, recommended findings of fact and a recommended disposition. Such report shall be sent to the City Clerk for a final determination of the facts and a final disposition.

   (15) Final decision.

      (i) The City Clerk's final decision shall be in writing and shall state reasons for the determinations and, when appropriate, direct specific action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such final decision need not be a separate formal document and a report submitted to the City Clerk pursuant to paragraph b(6) or b(14) hereof together with a letter from the City Clerk concurring with the recommended findings of fact and recommended disposition shall constitute a final decision. In reaching such final decision, the City Clerk may review the petition and answer and memoranda of law of the parties, if any, and any record of the hearing. The City Clerk shall not be bound by the ALJ's recommendation.

      (ii) A copy of such final decision shall be mailed by the City Clerk to the applicant and his or her attorney or representative, if any, and the spouse of record, if any.

      (iii) Any of the aggrieved parties have the right to judicial review in accordance with the provisions of Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.

(b) Where a party to the marriage sends a third party to obtain their marriage record without a letter of authorization, that third party may make the request and pay the fee if that third party consents to having the record mailed directly to the party to the marriage. The record will not be released directly to the unauthorized third party.

(c) If a person requires information regarding a current or prospective spouse's marital history, the Office of the City Clerk will, upon the payment of the appropriate search fee, the furnishing of an approximate marriage date, and sufficient information to search under at least one party's name, confirm only the fact of a prior marriage or a subsequent fraudulent acquisition of a marriage certificate with a party other than the inquiring spouse subsequent to their marriage by a "yes" or "no" answer.

Upon receipt of the answer the City Clerk shall forward a copy thereof to OATH.
