Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, a unit having a history of Department closure(s), being the subject of complaints of unsanitary conditions, or being compromised following an environmental emergency.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a new inspection cycle shall commence whenever:

   (1) A mobile food vending unit changes from a pushcart to a vehicle or from a vehicle to a pushcart, as such terms are defined in 24 RCNY Health Code Article 89.

If the unit has been issued no prior grade card, it shall have no posting until its reinspection.

(c) If a mobile food vending unit receives a score of 14 or more points on the reinspection, and is not closed by the Department, the Department shall post on the unit a “grade pending” card. If the permit-holder elects to have the grade of “B” or “C” earned at the reinspection posted to the unit instead of a “grade pending” card, the permit-holder may contact the Department to arrange for the unit to be brought to a place designated by the Department so the Department may post the preliminary grade.

(d) Grading after adjudication of summonses. Where a unit scores 14 or more points on a reinspection and was issued one or more summons for findings made at that inspection, the following shall apply:

   (1) Except as described in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, within 42 days of the reinspection date that generated the summons, the permit-holder shall contact the Department to arrange for the posting of the final letter grade for that inspection cycle.

   (2) If the permit-holder adjudicates all summonses associated with the reinspection on or before the hearing date listed on those summonses but has not received hearing decisions within 42 days from the time of reinspection, the permit-holder may continue to post a “grade pending” card until hearing decisions are issued. In this instance, the permit-holder shall have five (5) days from the date of decision to contact the Department to arrange for posting of the final letter grade for that inspection cycle.

   (3) It shall be the duty of the permit-holder to check the status of summons and comply with the timeframes of this section for the posting of letter grades.

No person other than the Department shall attempt to or actually remove, dispose of, obstruct, tamper with, or modify a location sharing device. Removing, disposing of, or tampering with, or in any way interfering with the operation of the location sharing device shall be grounds to revoke a mobile food vending permit or license or both.

(d) In the event the Department determines that the location sharing device on a mobile food vending unit is not functioning, it may issue a written order to the permit holder to bring the unit to a location designated by the Department. Upon receiving such an order, a permit holder must bring the unit to the designated location within five (5) days unless otherwise instructed by the Department.

(e) The Department shall use the data obtained from a location sharing device only to locate a unit for the purposes of enforcing the provisions of this Chapter, the State Sanitary Code, the Health Code, the Administrative Code, Public Health Law, other Rule of the City of New York, or as otherwise required by a lawful order of a court with proper jurisdiction.

Chapter 14: Cleaning Park Playground Equipment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 14-01 Scope and applicability.*


This Chapter applies to park playground equipment that is located within a playground operated by or under the jurisdiction of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (hereinafter referred to as “Department of Parks”).








*§ 14-02 Definitions.*


When used in this Chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:

“Minimum distance from the application of pesticide” means how near park playground equipment can be to the spraying of a pesticide without requiring the park playground equipment to be cleaned, pursuant to § 18-148 of the Administrative Code.

“No observed adverse effect level” means the highest exposure level of a chemical at which no harmful effects have been seen in research and scientific studies, and which represents the common benchmark used by the Federal environmental protection agency and the food and drug administration for risk classification and assessment of chemicals, including pesticides.

“Playground” means an outdoor area open to the public where children play, which contains play equipment such as a sliding board, swing, jungle gym, or see-saw, or which is designated as a play area.

“Park playground equipment” means playground equipment which is located within a playground operated by or under the jurisdiction of the department of parks, including those for which the department of parks has an agreement with a conservancy or other not-for-profit organization with respect to operation of any aspect of a playground.

“Pesticide” means:

Chapter 16: Criteria For Issuing Special Vehicle Identification Permits To Disabled Persons
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 16-01 Introduction.*


This rule establishes criteria for the issuing of Special Vehicle Identification Parking Permits (SVIPP), also known as Parking Permits for People with Disabilities (PPPD), pursuant to § 2903(a)(15)(a) of the New York City Charter, to or on behalf of disabled persons who have a permanent disability seriously impairing mobility and authorizes the use of physicians designated by the Department, including New York City Health &amp; Hospitals Corporation employed physicians so designated pursuant to a contract entered into by the Department with the Health &amp; Hospitals Corporation and the Department of Transportation, to make the decisions as to the eligibility of such persons for these special permits.






*§ 16-02 Permanent Disabilities Seriously Impairing Mobility.*


For the purposes of § 2903(a)(15)(a) of the New York City Charter the following conditions constitute permanent disabilities that seriously impair mobility:

(a) Complete monoplegia or paraplegia of lower extremities.

(b) Above ankle amputation of lower extremities, at the discretion of the examining physician. Well-fitted below the knee prosthesis with normal ambulatory gait should not routinely be regarded as mobility impaired.

(c) Arthritis of two major weight bearing joints of the lower extremities with clearly substantial X-rays changes and/or MRI changes, such as loss of joint space, severe degenerative changes plus one or more of the following:

   (1) Objective finding of sizable effusion of joint(s) detected by clinical examination

   (2) Gross instability or valgus/varus deformities of joint(s) detected by clinical examination

   (3) Ankylosis or contracture of major joint(s) to such a degree as to preclude stair climbing. Joint replacement does not qualify by itself unless accompanied by one or more of the above criteria.

(d) Severe atrophy of one or both lower extremities (or discrepancy in leg lengths greater than three inches) which clearly and seriously impairs mobility.

(e) Spinal column abnormalities of severe degree with unequivocal motor involvement not amenable to bracing or surgery which would seriously and permanently impair mobility. X-ray evidence of arthritis of the spine with or without pain is insufficient reason for approval. CT Scan, MRI and/or EMG results must be available for review prior to a decision.

(f) Neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, myopathies, Parkinsonism and Alzheimer's Disease, affecting both lower extremities that would seriously impair mobility. Objective documentation (i.e., MRI, EMG, nerve conduction studies, et al.) must be submitted, where appropriate, by the applicant.

(g) Cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease of severe degree resulting in mobility impairment. Cardiovascular disease must meet ADA Class III or IV criteria; stress test, echocardiogram, Doppler or other diagnostic studies must support evidence of significant pathology and/or disability.

(h) Pulmonary disease with documented evidence of severe obstructive or restrictive disease on pulmonary function testing. Evidence of use of supplemental oxygen for more than twelve hours per day may also be acceptable evidence of impairment.

(i) Renal insufficiency requiring frequent renal dialysis with significant objective finding of neural or hemic abnormalities.

(j) Malignancies of any category that require chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy or other medical interventions which continuously and seriously impair mobility.

(k) Post-Polio syndrome that on examination clearly and seriously impairs mobility.

(l) AIDS related conditions, including peripheral neuropathy, wasting syndrome, dementia, which clearly seriously impair mobility on physical examination.

(m) Mental conditions resulting in mental retardation of a severe nature documented by appropriate psychological evaluation, which permanently and seriously impair mobility.

(n) Congenital diseases of any type that clearly result in permanent serious mobility impairment, including cerebral palsy, spina bifida and Down syndrome.

(o) Any other permanent disability that in the specific circumstances, would seriously impair the mobility of the applicant.






*§ 16-03 Physicians Employed by Health &amp; Hospitals Corporation Designated to Perform Special Vehicle Identification Parking Permit Certifications.*


The Department may use physicians, made available for this purpose by the Health &amp; Hospitals Corporation pursuant to a contract entered into by the Department with the Health &amp; Hospitals Corporation and the Department of Transportation, to perform medical certifications of Special Vehicle Identification Parking Permit applications submitted to the Department of Transportation. Such physicians, employed by the Health &amp; Hospitals Corporation, shall be qualified to certify persons for a Special Vehicle Identification Parking Permit as possessing a "permanent disability seriously impairing mobility" in accordance with § 2903(15)(a) of the Charter and the criteria specified in 24 RCNY § 16-02 above. A practitioner in an appropriate field of specialization may be used to perform a medical certification when deemed necessary by the non-specialist/physician assessing the person's medical eligibility for a SVIPP.






*§ 16-04 Certification.*


(a)  Certification Form. The Physician Certification Form shall state that, after a review of the SVIPP application and any accompanying documentation furnished by the applicant's personal physician, it has been determined that the applicant does or does not have a "permanent disability seriously impairing mobility". Where certification has been denied, the Form shall indicate whether that determination was based upon the fact that the medical documentation presented does not support a finding of a "permanent disability seriously impairing mobility" or because the clinical findings are inconsistent with the applicant's medical history or otherwise does not support the finding of a "permanent disability seriously impairing mobility". Except as otherwise provided in 24 RCNY § 16-05, such determination shall be final when it is adopted by the Department.

(b) Post-Certification Reevaluation. In certain cases where certification has been granted, an applicant may be required to submit, at some future time designated by the physician/provider at the time of certification, to a reevaluation/reassessment of his (her) medical condition in order to determine whether the applicant continues to have a "permanent disability seriously impairing mobility". The decision to require a reevaluation of the applicant shall not be subject to appeal pursuant to 24 RCNY § 16-05.






*§ 16-05 Appeals.*


Where certification has been denied, an applicant for a Special Vehicle Identification Parking Permit may appeal such determination. Such request for appeal must be made within thirty business days of service of the decision denying the certification upon the applicant on a form received with the decision. Where the denial of certification was based upon a determination/finding that the medical history of the person does not support a finding of a "permanent disability seriously impairing mobility", the Department shall provide for a review of the file by a physician other than the physician who denied such certification. Where such denial was based upon clinical findings, or where the clinical findings were inconsistent with the medical history of the person, the Department shall provide a second assessment, which may include a physical examination by a physician selected by the Department other than the physician who denied certification. The applicant/appellant shall not be precluded from engaging an outside medical expert or specialist for purposes of his or her appeal. The results of any examination performed by such specialist and his or her conclusions shall be made part of the appeal record. The Department, or provider designated by the Department, may also provide a second assessment by a specialist when deemed necessary by the physician/provider. The results of the examination by this specialist shall also be made part of the appeal record. The determination of such appeal shall be final when it is adopted by the Department. A final determination denying certification shall preclude the filing of a Special Vehicle Identification Parking Permit application for the same condition by or on behalf of such person unless such person demonstrates that the condition has significantly worsened.

Such procedure shall allow persons requesting a place on any of the six waiting lists to submit a waiting list application, which shall contain their license number and the type of permit they seek, by mail postmarked during a period of time to be determined by the Division of Permits, which shall be specified in the Notice published pursuant to 24 RCNY § 19-04. A person's eligibility for inclusion on the waiting lists authorized to be created pursuant to these rules shall be limited. Persons shall be eligible for inclusion on the full-term waiting list, the temporary permit waiting list and one borough-specific full-term permit waiting list of the applicant's choice at any one time. Pursuant to § 17-307(b)(2)(c) a person shall be issued no more than one permit, whether full-term, borough-specific full-term, or temporary.






*§ 19-06 Procedure for Establishment of Permit Waiting Lists.*


Not less than 45 days after the Notice required by 24 RCNY § 19-04 is published in the City Record, the Department shall create a full-term permit waiting list, a temporary permit waiting list and four separate borough-specific full-term permit waiting lists pursuant to a random selection procedure. Persons holding valid mobile food vendor licenses, or in the case of a corporation, limited liability company or partnership, persons on whose behalf such licenses are held on the date such lists are created and who have mailed in an application pursuant to 24 RCNY § 19-05 shall be included in this random selection. Persons who, as a result of this random selection procedure, hold position numbers greater than the maximum number specified in 24 RCNY § 19-07 for the particular list shall not be placed on that waiting list. The Department shall notify persons assigned a position on a waiting list by mailing a notice to the address provided by the applicant in such applicant's waiting list application.






*§ 19-07 Number of Positions on the Waiting Lists.*


The maximum number of positions on the full-term permit waiting list shall be determined by the Department's Permits Division so as to provide a reasonable number of potential applicants to fill vacancies as they arise, but in no event shall such list exceed two thousand five hundred (2,500) positions. The maximum number of positions on the temporary permit waiting list shall be determined by the Department's Permits Division so as to provide a reasonable number of potential applicants to fill vacancies as they arise, but in no event shall such waiting list exceed one thousand (1,000) positions. When the number of potential applicants on either the full-term or temporary permit waiting lists falls below two hundred (200), the Permits Division shall supplement such waiting lists with additional names pursuant to the procedure specified in 24 RCNY §§ 19-03 through 19-05. The maximum number of positions on each of the four waiting lists for full-term permits to be used exclusively for vending in the specified boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island shall also be determined by the Department's Permits Division so as to provide a reasonable number of potential applicants to fill future vacancies as they arise. In no event shall any of these borough-specific permit waiting lists exceed one hundred (100) positions or four hundred (400) for all borough-specific list positions combined. When the number of potential applicants on any of the borough-specific permit waiting lists falls below twenty-five (25), the Permits Division shall seek to supplement such waiting list with additional names pursuant to the procedure specified in 24 RCNY §§ 19-03 through 19-05.






*§ 19-08 Responsibility of Those on Waiting Lists to Notify the Department of Change of Address.*


The names of persons selected for a waiting list created pursuant to these rules shall be entered on each list with their address of record as known to the Department through mobile food vendor license records, in the case of a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, the address of such corporation, partnership or limited liability company and the residence and business address of the officer, partner, manager, or member holding a mobile food vendor license who is authorized to act on behalf of such corporation, partnership, or limited liability company shall be entered. Thereafter, it shall be the responsibility of each person placed on a waiting list to provide written notification to the Department of any change of address. The Department shall provide written confirmation of its receipt of such address change notification. The failure to provide change of address information may result in the loss of a person's waiting list position(s). Any person who does not respond to any notice of the Department mailed to his or her address of record as known to the Department through mobile food vendor license records because change of address information was not provided to the Department in a timely manner shall be deemed to have abandoned his or her place on a waiting list and shall not be reinstated to any list unless such person participates in a process of list establishment pursuant to 24 RCNY §§ 19-03 through 19-06. The Department's written confirmation of its receipt of a change of address notification shall constitute proof that such notification was provided to the Department.






*§ 19-09 Multiple Waiting List Positions on Any Single List Prohibited.*


A person may submit waiting list applications for positions on the following specific lists: the full-term permit waiting list, the temporary permit waiting list and one of the four borough-specific permit waiting lists that are to be created pursuant to these rules. A person may not, under any circumstances, occupy more than one waiting list position on any of the three waiting lists selected by the applicant and no person shall be eligible to obtain more than one permit. Before the creation of any of these lists through the random selection process, the Department shall ensure that a mobile food vendor licensee is represented only once in the pool of licensees from which the random listing or selection to each list is made. For purposes of the waiting lists only, officers, members, managers and partners who represent corporations, limited liability companies and partnerships that are current mobile food unit permit holders shall not be excluded from the pool from which the randomized waiting lists are to be created solely on the basis that such officer, member, manager or partner is a licensee acting on behalf of a corporation, limited liability company or partnership, provided each such individual possesses a valid mobile food vendor license in accordance with these rules. Such officers, members, managers and partners, will be deemed to be representing themselves as individuals, and not the corporation, limited liability company or partnership with which they are associated, when placed on any waiting list, and shall be placed on any such waiting list in their individual capacities. Where such individual is acting on behalf of a corporation, limited liability company or partnership, the name of the corporation, limited liability company or partnership shall be placed on a waiting list with the name of the individual who is acting on its behalf. No partner, member or manager of a limited liability company or director, shareholder or officer of a corporation shall appear on the same waiting list as the partnership, limited liability company or corporation which he or she represents and/or has an interest in unless he or she holds the waiting list position in his or her individual capacity. Should the Department receive more than one request for a waiting list position from any person, requests subsequent to the first shall be deemed invalid. A person who submits more than one request for a position on any single waiting list will be disqualified and denied a position on the list if such multiple requests are deemed, in the sole discretion of the Department, to adversely affect the fairness or orderly establishment of a list. Nothing herein, which allows a person the right to hold a waiting list position in an individual capacity shall be deemed to give such person the right to obtain a mobile food unit permit in violation of § 17-307(b), (f) and (g) of the New York City Administrative Code.






*§ 19-10 Selection of Applicants From a Waiting List.*


When the number of outstanding full-term mobile food unit permits falls below two thousand eight hundred (2,800), the statutory maximum of three thousand (3,000) imposed by § 17-307(b)(2)(a) of the New York City Administrative Code less the two hundred (200) designated exclusively for use in specified boroughs by § 17-307(b)(2)(b)(i), and at such time as the Department in its discretion may determine based upon a consideration of the number of vacancies, a number of persons on the waiting list equal to the number of vacancies shall be notified by the Department, in waiting list order, of their eligibility to apply for a full-term mobile food unit permit and shall form a pool of prospective applicants. When the number of temporary mobile food unit permits outstanding falls below the statutory maximum of one thousand (1,000) imposed by § 17-307(f)(3)(a) of the Administrative Code, and at such time as the Department in its discretion may determine based upon a consideration of the number of vacancies, a sufficient number of persons on the waiting list equal to the number of vacancies shall be notified by the Department, in waiting list order, of their eligibility to apply for a temporary mobile food unit permit and shall form a pool of prospective applicants. When the number of borough-specific full-term mobile food unit permits outstanding for a particular borough falls below the statutory maximum of fifty (50) imposed by § 17-307(b)(2)(b)(i) of the Administrative Code and at such time as the Department in its discretion may determine based upon a consideration of the number of vacancies, a sufficient number of persons on the waiting list for that borough equal to the number of vacancies shall be notified in waiting list order of their eligibility to apply for a permit to be used exclusively in the specific borough and shall form a pool of prospective applicants. Only one permit shall be issued for each eligible waiting list position or applicant.






*§ 19-11 Eligibility to Apply for a Mobile Food Vending Unit Permit.*


Only those persons who have been notified that their waiting list number has been reached shall be eligible to submit an application for a mobile food unit permit. A person whose waiting list number is reached and who holds a full-term, temporary or full-term borough-specific mobile food unit permit including a person who is deemed to hold such a permit pursuant to subdivision g of § 17-307 of the Administrative Code, shall not be eligible for a permit with respect to such waiting list position unless such previously held permit is surrendered or expires before a permit with respect to such waiting list position is issued. Positions on a waiting list shall not be transferable.






*§ 19-12 Notification of Eligibility to Apply for Permit.*


Within ninety (90) days of the date that notification of eligibility to apply for a permit authorized to be issued by § 17-307 of the Administrative Code is mailed, a person desiring to obtain such permit shall submit an application, completed in accordance with 24 RCNY Health Code § 5.05, together with the requisite fees therefor. The permit application shall be postmarked on or before the ninetieth day.






*§ 19-13 Failure to Make Application for Permit.*


The failure of any person on a waiting list who is notified of eligibility to apply for a permit, to complete the permit application process within ninety (90) days of being so notified, shall result in the forfeiture of such person's waiting list position.






*§ 19-14 Abandonment of Waiting List Position.*


A person who does not respond within ninety (90) days to a Departmental inquiry concerning a waiting list position held by such person, mailed by ordinary mail to the address provided by such person, shall be deemed to have abandoned such waiting list position.

Chapter 20: Preference And/or Waiting List Rule For Full-term Mobile Food Unit Permits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 20-01 Definitions.*


(a)  Words and terms used in this rule shall have the meanings specified in § 17-306 of the Administrative Code.

(b) "Establishment", "establish" or "established" shall refere to the initial creation of the preference and/or waiting list required by § 17-307(b)(3) as well as all subsequent supplementations and re-establishments of such list as necessary for filling both vacancies to the list and waiting list positions for these permits.






*§ 20-02 Direction to Establish Preference and/or Waiting Lists.*


The Department shall establish, as required, separate preference and/or waiting lists for full-term mobile food unit permits for the preference categories specified in § 17-307(b)(3)(b) of the Administrative Code. With regard to the first preference category specified in § 17-307(b)(3)(i), the Department may create an alternative waiting list based upon a random selection of one-hundred (100) candidates from the defined class of disabled veterans formerly holding general vendor licenses.






*§ 20-03 Eligibility for Place on Preference and/or Waiting Lists.*


To be eligible for inclusion on a preference and/or waiting list established pursuant to this rule an applicant must be a natural person holding a valid mobile food vendor license at least ten days prior to the date that the Department establishes such list. In addition, he or she must belong to a preference category established by § 17-307(b)(3), must not already hold a full-term mobile food unit permit and/or have had such a permit previously revoked or suspended.






*§ 20-04 Notice of the Establishment of Preference and/or Waiting Lists.*


Notice of the Department's establishment of a preference and/or waiting list, shall be made by publication in the City Record specifying the preference category for which such list is being established, at least forty-five days prior to the establishment of the waiting list, and by mail, also at least forty-five days prior to the establishment of the list, to all eligible persons holding mobile food vendor licenses, as well as other interested parties known to the Department, including persons known to the Department who are in superior preference categories. Such notice shall advise that only those natural persons in possession of valid mobile food vendor licenses at least ten days prior to the establishment of a preference and/or waiting list shall be eligible for inclusion on such list.






*§ 20-05 Procedure for Requesting a Place on a Preference and/or Waiting List.*


The Division of Permits shall use a mail-in procedure for establishing preference and/or waiting lists. Such procedure shall allow persons requesting a place on a preference and/or waiting list to submit a preference and/or waiting list application. Each such application shall contain the applicant's license number and preference category. The application shall be submitted by mail, postmarked during a period of time to be determined by the Division of Permits as specified in the notice published pursuant to 24 RCNY § 20-04 above.






*§ 20-06 Procedure for Establishment of Preference and/or Waiting List.*


Not less than forty-five days after the Notice required by 24 RCNY § 20-04 is published in the City Record, the Department shall create a preference and/or waiting list pursuant to a random selection procedure. Persons holding valid mobile food vendor licenses at least ten days prior to the date such preference and/or waiting list is created and who have mailed in an application pursuant to 24 RCNY § 20-05 shall be included in the random selection. Persons who, as a result of this random selection procedure, hold position numbers greater than the maximum number specified in 24 RCNY § 20-07 shall not be placed on the preference and/or waiting list. Each qualified applicant for a preference and/or waiting list position shall be eligible for one permit and one position on the preference and/or waiting list. The person's position on a preference and/or waiting list shall be determined by his or her preference category and the order in which his or her name is randomly selected within such preference category. The Department shall notify persons assigned a position on the preference and/or waiting list by mailing a notice to the address provided by the applicant in the applicant's preference and/or waiting list application.






*§ 20-07 Number of Positions on a Preference and/or Waiting List.*


The maximum number of positions on a preference and/or waiting list shall be determined by the Department's Permit Division so as to provide a reasonable number of potential applicants for the permits currently available as well as to fill future vacancies as they arise. In no event shall a preference and/or waiting list exceed one hundred (100) positions. After the initial issuance of the one hundred permits authorized by § 17-307(b)(3), the Permits Division may supplement a preference and/or waiting list with additional names pursuant to the procedures specified in 24 RCNY §§ 20-04 through 20-06. Prior to supplementing a preference and/or waiting list by giving notice and an opportunity to apply for a waiting list position to a particular preference group, in accordance with the procedures outlined in 24 RCNY §§ 20-04 through 20-06, the Permits Division shall first notify and solicit applications for a preference and/or waiting list from all persons known to the Department who are in all superior preference categories. Those in a superior preference category will be given priority over those in a lower preference category in the filling of any vacancy.






*§ 20-08 Responsibility of Those on Preference and/or Waiting List to Notify the Department of Change of Address.*


The names of persons selected for a position on a preference and/or waiting list created pursuant to these rules shall be entered on this list with their address of record as known to the Department through mobile food vendor license records. Thereafter, it shall be the responsibility of each person placed on a preference and/or waiting list to provide written notification to the Department of any change of address. The Department shall provide written confirmation of its receipt of such address change notification. The failure to provide change of address information or, when requested, proof of the Department's confirmation of receipt of such written notification, may result in the loss of a person's preference and/or waiting list position and such person's eligibility to apply for a mobile food unit permit issued pursuant to § 17-307(b)(3) of the Administrative Code. Such person shall be deemed to have abandoned his or her place on the preference and/or waiting list and will not be reinstated to the list unless such person participates in the process of list establishment pursuant to 24 RCNY §§ 20-03 through 20-06. The Department's written confirmation of its receipt of a change of address notification shall constitute proof that such notification was provided to the Department.






*§ 20-09 Multiple Requests for Preference and/or Waiting List Position Prohibited.*


No more than one preference and/or waiting list position shall be granted to any person, who shall be eligible to obtain only one permit. Before the creation of the preference and/or waiting list through the random selection process, the Department shall ensure that a mobile food vendor licensee is represented only once in the pool of licensees from which the random listing and selection is to be made. Should the Department receive more than one request from any person, requests subsequent to the first shall be deemed invalid. A person who submits more than one request for a position on the preference and/or waiting list may be disqualified and denied a position on the list if such multiple requests are deemed, in the sole discretion of the Department, to adversely affect the fairness or orderly establishment of a list.






*§ 20-10 Selection of Applicants From Preference and/or Waiting List.*


When the number of permits outstanding falls below the statutory maximum of one-hundred (100) and at such time as the Department in its discretion may determine based upon a consideration of the number of vacancies, a number of persons on the preference and/or waiting list equal to the number of vacancies shall be notified by the Department, in preference and waiting list order, of their eligibility to apply for a full-term mobile food unit permit and shall form a pool of prospective applicants. Vacancies shall be filled from the highest preference category for which an applicant exists either on a waiting list or who may be identified as the result of the published notice specified in 24 RCNY § 20-04.






*§ 20-11 Eligibility to Apply for a Mobile Food Unit Permit.*

A person whose preference and/or waiting list number is reached and who holds a full-term, temporary or full-term borough-specific mobile food unit permit pursuant to subdivision g of § 17-307 of the Administrative Code, shall not be eligible for a permit pursuant to this preference and/or waiting list rule unless such previously held permit is surrendered or expires before a permit with respect to such waiting list position is issued. Positions on a preference and/or waiting list shall not be transferable.






*§ 20-12 Notification of Eligibility to Apply for Permit.*

The permit application shall be submitted on or before the ninetieth day.






*§ 20-13 Failure to Make Application for Permit.*

*§ 20-14 Abandonment of Preference and/or Waiting List Position.*


A person who does not respond within ninety (90) days to a Departmental inquiry concerning a preference and/or waiting list position held by such person, mailed by ordinary mail to the address provided by such person, shall be deemed to have abandoned such list position.

*§ 23-03 Letter grading.*


(a)  The Department, whenever practicable and subject to 24 RCNY § 23-04, shall conduct an inspection cycle at least annually at each food service establishment required by 24 RCNY Health Code § 81.51 to post a letter grade for the purpose of issuing such establishment a grade that identifies and represents that establishment's compliance with those laws and regulations that require it to operate in a sanitary manner so as to protect public health. Based on the results of either the initial inspection or reinspection in a cycle, an establishment shall in accordance with these rules be issued a letter grade of either "A," "B," or "C" for that cycle, except that an establishment shall not receive any grade if the Department orders that it be closed.

The score received on any compliance inspection shall not change an establishment's letter grade for that cycle.






*§ 23-04 Intervals between inspection cycles.*


(a)  A food service establishment shall post its letter grade until the Department issues it a new letter grade card or until a "grade pending" card is required to be posted in the establishment's next inspection cycle. The Department shall not wait one year to schedule the next inspection cycle for any establishment that receives 14 or more points on its initial inspection, but instead the interval of time between the final inspection in such cycle and the initial inspection in the establishment's next cycle shall be determined by the higher score from either its initial inspection or its reinspection:

   (1) An initial inspection commencing a new cycle shall be conducted 150 to 210 days after the reinspection at an establishment that receives a score of 14 to 27 points on an initial inspection or reinspection and does not score 28 or more points on either of these inspections.

   (2) An initial inspection commencing a new cycle shall be conducted 90 to 150 days after the final inspection of the cycle at an establishment that receives a score of 28 or more points on its initial inspection or reinspection.

   (3) An initial inspection commencing a new cycle shall be conducted within 60 to 120 days of reopening for an establishment that is authorized by the Department to reopen following a Department closure that occurs on an initial or reinspection of that establishment.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter to the contrary, in circumstances when the Department believes there is an increased risk to public health, nothing in this section shall prohibit the Department from inspecting an establishment and treating that inspection as the initial inspection in a new cycle. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, an establishment having a history of Department closure(s), being the subject of complaints of unsanitary conditions, or being compromised following an environmental emergency.






*§ 23-05 Notices of violation and penalties for sustained violations.*


(a)  The Department shall issue a notice of violation whenever a food service establishment is cited on any sanitary inspection for one or more critical violations or accumulates 14 or more points, regardless of whether any critical violations are cited on such inspection.

(b) All violations shall be recorded and/or cited individually on inspection reports and notices of violation.

(c) A Health Tribunal hearing examiner must impose the penalty set forth in Appendix C of this Chapter for any sustained violation.






*§ 23-06 Revocation or suspension of permits.*


(a)  Findings of serious and persistent violations or uncorrected public health hazards on any sanitary inspection may provide the basis for commencement of a proceeding to revoke or suspend a permit pursuant to 24 RCNY Health Code Article 5.

(b) The Department shall post signs on any establishment that it orders closed indicating that such establishment is not open to the public and shall remove any posted grade-related card.

(c) Prior to authorizing any closed establishment being allowed to re-open, the Department shall conduct a re-opening inspection. The Department may conduct as many inspections as it deems necessary to determine whether the establishment is in compliance with applicable law and may be reopened for operation.

(d) If an establishment that is required by 24 RCNY Health Code § 81.51 to post a letter grade is closed and then allowed to re-open, upon re-opening, the grade card that had been posted by the establishment before the closure will be posted again, except that where the closure occurred on the establishment's initial inspection, a "grade pending" card shall be posted, and any grade card previously posted shall be removed, and where the closure occurred on a reinspection a "grade pending" card or the letter grade card corresponding to the score on the reinspection shall be posted.






*§ 23-07 Posting letter grades.*


(a)  The Department shall at the time of inspection provide any establishment required by 24 RCNY Health Code § 81.51 to post a letter grade that receives a score of 13 or less on an initial or reinspection with a grade card displaying the letter grade "A," which shall be posted immediately by the establishment.

(b) If an establishment required by 24 RCNY Health Code § 81.51 to post a letter grade receives a score of 14 or more points on an initial inspection, and is not closed by the Department, it shall continue to post its grade card from the prior cycle until its reinspection. If the establishment has been issued no prior grade card, it shall have no posting until its reinspection.

(c) If an establishment required by 24 RCNY Health Code § 81.51 to post a letter grade receives a score of 14 or more points on the reinspection, and is not closed by the Department, the Department shall provide the establishment with a "grade pending" card and a grade card displaying the letter grade that corresponds with its inspection score at the reinspection. The establishment shall immediately post either the grade card or the "grade pending" card. If the establishment elects to post the "grade pending" card, it may only do so until it has had an opportunity to be heard at the Health Tribunal pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section and 24 RCNY Health Code § 81.51.

(d) Effect of adjudication at the Health Tribunal on grading of establishments required by 24 RCNY Health Code § 81.51 to post letter grades:

   (1) If the establishment appears personally at the Health Tribunal and as a result of such proceeding the score received on a reinspection does not change the grade, the establishment shall immediately upon receipt of the notice of decision remove any posted "grade pending" card and post the grade card provided by the Department at such inspection.

   (2) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this subdivision, if the establishment does not appear at the Health Tribunal on or before the scheduled hearing date, the establishment shall, on the date of the hearing, post the letter grade card provided by the Department at the reinspection.

   (3) If the establishment appears at the Health Tribunal on the scheduled date but is unable to proceed, or if the establishment makes a timely request for an adjournment and such adjournment is granted, the establishment may continue to post the "grade pending" card and defer posting the letter grade card until the adjourned hearing date. In no event shall an establishment fail to post the grade card after the adjourned hearing date if the establishment is not able to proceed on such date.

   (4) If the establishment appears at the Health Tribunal and as a result of such proceeding the score received for the reinspection changes in a way that results in a change of grade, the Department shall provide the establishment with a new letter grade card that shall be promptly posted by the establishment in place of any other letter grade card or "grade pending" card.

   (5) If the establishment receives notice of decision by mail, the establishment shall immediately upon receipt of the notice of decision remove any grade pending card and post the grade card provided with the notice of decision, if any. If no new grade card is issued with the notice of decision, the establishment shall immediately post the grade card issued by the Department at the reinspection.

   (6) When an establishment settles the notice of violation issued at the reinspection by mail, online, or in person, the establishment shall immediately upon settlement post the grade card issued by the Department at such reinspection.

   (7) The disposition of any notice of violation at the Health Tribunal shall not affect any provision of this Chapter or other applicable law other than the issuance of a grade.

(e) An establishment required by 24 RCNY Health Code § 81.51 to post a letter grade shall shred or otherwise dispose of all non-current letter grade cards and "grade pending" cards in a manner that prevents reuse of the cards.

(f) The "grade pending" or letter grade card shall be posted in a conspicuous place where it is visible to passersby. The card shall be placed on the front window, door or exterior wall of an establishment required by 24 RCNY Health Code § 81.51 to post a letter grade. The card shall be within five feet of the front door or other opening to the establishment where customers enter from the street, at a vertical height no less than four feet and no more than six feet from the ground or floor. An establishment without a direct entrance from the street shall post the grade card or "grade pending" card at a place designated by the Department at its immediate point of entry so that it is clearly visible to passersby.

(g) Letter grade cards shall not be removed except when authorized by the Department.

Chapter 26: Establishment and Maintenance of Separate Borough Specific Waiting Lists For Those Seeking Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Permits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 26-01 Definitions.*


(a)  Words and terms used in this Chapter shall have the meanings specified in § 17-306 of the Administrative Code.

(b) "Establishment", "establish", "establishing" or "established" shall refer to the initial creation of the five separate borough specific waiting lists for fresh fruits and vegetables mobile food unit permits as well as all subsequent supplementations and re-establishments of any of these lists as necessary for filling both permit vacancies and waiting list positions for these permits.






*§ 26-02 Direction to Establish Waiting Lists.*


The Department shall establish five separate waiting lists for fresh fruits and vegetables permits that are designated for use exclusively in the boroughs of Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Manhattan and Staten Island. The waiting lists shall take into account the four preference categories listed in § 17-307(b)(4)(e) of the Administrative Code, including the additional preferences described in § 17-307(b)(4)(e)(i) of such Code.






*§ 26-03 Preferences on Waiting Lists.*


Establishment of the five borough specific waiting lists in accordance with this Chapter shall be in accordance with the preference categories and any additional preferences within a preference category as listed in § 17-307(b)(4)(e) of the Administrative Code. No person shall be placed on a borough specific fruits and vegetables waiting list pursuant to this Chapter in a higher position than any person who is given a greater preference pursuant to § 17-307(b)(4)(e). Persons with a higher preference shall be given a higher weighted value in the selection process used to establish the borough specific fruits and vegetables waiting lists created pursuant to this Chapter. Persons who appear on any existing mobile food unit permit waiting list on the effective date of Local Law No. 9 of 2008 and who also classify themselves as disabled veterans shall receive a weighted value of 8. Persons who appear on any existing mobile food unit permit waiting list on the effective date of Local Law No. 9 of 2008 and who also classify themselves as disabled persons shall receive a weighted value of 7. Persons who appear on any existing mobile food unit permit waiting list on the effective date of Local Law No. 9 of 2008 and who also classify themselves as non-disabled veterans shall receive a weighted value of 6. Any other persons who appear on any existing mobile food unit permit waiting lists on the effective date of Local Law No. 9 of 2008 shall receive a weighted value of 5.

Persons not appearing on any existing mobile food unit permit waiting lists on the effective date of Local Law No. 9 of 2008 but who classify themselves as disabled persons shall receive a weighted value of 3. Persons not appearing on any existing mobile food unit permit waiting list on the effective date of Local Law No. 9 of 2008 but who classify themselves as non-disabled veterans shall receive a weighted value 2. All other persons shall receive a weighted value of 1. Persons of the same weighted value shall be placed on borough specific fruits and vegetables waiting lists in order pursuant to the borough rankings indicated by such persons in their applications.






*§ 26-04 Eligibility for Placement on Borough Specific Waiting Lists for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Permits.*


To be eligible for inclusion on any of the waiting lists established pursuant to this Chapter, applicants shall be natural persons holding a valid mobile food vendor license at least ten (10) days prior to the Department's establishment of the borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables permit waiting lists created pursuant to this Chapter.






*§ 26-05 Notice of the Establishment of Borough Specific Waiting Lists for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Permits.*


Notice of the Department's intention to establish fresh fruits and vegetables borough specific waiting lists shall be made by publication in the City Record at least fourteen days prior to the establishment of such lists.






*§ 26-06 Procedure for Requesting a Place on Waiting Lists.*


(a)  The Division of Permits shall use a mail-in procedure for establishing all waiting lists. Such procedure shall allow persons requesting placement on one or more of the five waiting lists established pursuant to this Chapter to submit a Department-issued waiting list application form, which shall contain their license number, their preference category, if applicable, and their choice(s) of borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables permit(s) they seek, by mail postmarked during a period of time to be determined by the Department, as specified in the Notice published pursuant to 24 RCNY § 26-05.

(b) The Notice shall advise those persons requesting placement on one or more of these five borough specific waiting list(s) to rank the waiting list(s) they select by order of borough choice. Applicants shall be directed to apply only for waiting list(s) for boroughs in which they would be willing to vend should they obtain such borough specific permit.

(c) Persons in the first preference category, as provided in § 17-307(b)(4)(e), shall not lose their position on any pre-existing waiting list as a result of their submission of an application for a fresh fruits and vegetables permit waiting list position or any resulting placement on any such list. A person on any existing waiting list who is issued a fresh fruits and vegetables permit also need not relinquish his or her place on any previously existing waiting list. Pursuant to § 17-307(b)(4)(b), however, a person shall be issued no more than one permit, whether full-term citywide, borough-specific full-term, temporary citywide or exclusively fresh fruits and vegetables.






*§ 26-07 Procedure for Establishment of Borough Specific Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Waiting Lists.*


Not less than fourteen days after the Notice required by 24 RCNY § 26-05 is published in the City Record, the Department shall create five separate borough specific full-term fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists. Applicants holding valid mobile food vendor licenses at least ten (10) days prior to the Department's establishment of the fresh fruits and vegetables borough specific waiting lists created pursuant to this Chapter shall be included in the selection process, subject to the preferences and weighted values described in 24 RCNY § 26-03. Each applicant eligible for a position on any of these borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists shall be able to obtain only one waiting list position per list. An applicant's position on a fresh fruits and vegetables borough specific waiting list shall be determined by his or her preference category, including the additional preferences within the category specified in § 17-307(b)(4)(e)(i) of the Administrative Code. Within each preference category, including the additional preferences within the category specified in § 17-307(b)(4)(e)(i) of the Administrative Code, those applicants specifying a borough as a preferred choice in which to operate shall be given preference on that borough's waiting list over those identifying that borough as a lesser choice. For each borough specific waiting list, applicants in identical preference categories, including the additional preferences within the category specified in § 17-307(b)(4)(e)(i) of the Administrative Code, who rank the applicable borough equally shall be placed on such borough specific waiting list in random order. The Department shall notify persons assigned a position on any of these waiting lists by mailing a notice to the address provided by the applicant on the applicant's waiting list application form.






*§ 26-08 Number of Positions on the Waiting Lists.*


The Department shall not impose a pre-set limit or maximum on the number of waiting list positions on each of the five borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists. Those applicants eligible for a waiting list position on any of the five borough specific waiting lists during the permit waiting list application period set by the Department shall be included on the waiting lists for which they applied. When it deems it necessary, the Department in its discretion may seek to supplement any specific borough waiting list or all waiting lists with additional names, pursuant to the procedure specified in 24 RCNY §§ 26-03 through 26-07, except that 24 RCNY § 26-06(b) shall not apply.






*§ 26-09 Responsibility of Those on Waiting Lists to Notify the Department of Change of Address.*


(a)  The names of persons selected for a waiting list created pursuant to this rule shall be entered on each list for which they apply with their address of record as known to the Department through mobile food vendor license records, or with any updated address provided to the Department on the waiting list application form. Thereafter, it shall be the responsibility of each person placed on a waiting list to provide written notification to the Department of any change of address. The Department shall provide written confirmation of its receipt of such address change notification. The Department's written confirmation of its receipt of a change of address notification shall constitute proof that such notification was provided to the Department.

(b) Failure to provide change of address information or, when requested, proof of the Department's confirmation of receipt of such written notification, may result in the loss of a person's waiting list position(s) and such person's eligibility to apply for a fresh fruits and vegetables permit pursuant to § 17-307(b)(4) of the Administrative Code. Such person shall be deemed to have abandoned his or her place(s) on any of these borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list(s) and shall not be eligible for a fresh fruits and vegetables permit unless such person participates in the process of list establishment pursuant to 24 RCNY §§ 26-03 through 26-07, except that 24 RCNY § 26-06(b) shall not apply.






*§ 26-10 Multiple Requests for Waiting List Position on any One Borough Specific Fruits and Vegetables Waiting List Prohibited.*


An applicant may apply for and obtain no more than one waiting list position on each of the borough specific waiting lists established pursuant to this Chapter and shall be eligible to obtain and possess only one permit. Before the creation of the borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists, the Department shall attempt to ascertain that a mobile food vendor licensee is represented only once in the pool of licensees from which the selection is to be made in producing each of the five borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables lists pursuant to 24 RCNY § 26-07. Should the Department receive more than one request for a waiting list position on any one borough list from any person, requests subsequent to the first shall be deemed invalid. A person who submits more than one request for a position on any one borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list created pursuant to these rules may be disqualified and denied a position on that borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list if such multiple requests are deemed, in the sole discretion of the Department, to adversely affect the fairness or orderly establishment of that specific borough list.






*§ 26-11 Selection of Applicants From a Waiting List.*


When the number of fresh fruits and vegetables permits outstanding for a particular borough falls below the statutory maximum for that borough and at such time as the Department in its discretion may determine based upon a consideration of the number of permit vacancies, a number of persons on such waiting list sufficient to fill the number of permit vacancies shall be notified by the Department, by waiting list order, of their eligibility to apply for a fresh fruits and vegetables permit to be used exclusively in a specific borough and shall form a pool of prospective applicants. Only one permit shall be issued for each eligible waiting list position or applicant.






*§ 26-12 Eligibility to Apply for a Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Permit.*


Only those persons who have been notified that their waiting list number has been reached shall be eligible to submit an application for a fresh fruits and vegetables borough specific permit. A person whose waiting list number is reached and who holds another mobile food unit permit issued by the Department to vend on public space, shall not be eligible for a fresh fruits and vegetables permit pursuant to this rule unless such previously held permit is surrendered or expires before a permit with respect to such fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list is issued. Positions on a waiting list shall not be transferable.






*§ 26-13 Notification of Eligibility to Apply For Permit.*


Within thirty (30) days of mailing notification of eligibility to apply for a fresh fruits and vegetables permit issued pursuant to § 17-307(b)(4) of the Administrative Code, a person desiring to obtain such permit shall submit an application, completed in accordance with 24 RCNY Health Code § 5.05, together with the requisite fees and requested supporting documentation therefore. The permit application shall be submitted on or before the thirtieth day.






*§ 26-14 Failure to Make Application for Permit or Complete Inspection Process, Declination of Permit.*


(a)  A person on a borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list who is notified of his or her eligibility to apply for a permit and who fails to submit a completed permit application to the Department within thirty (30) days of being notified by the Department, or who otherwise communicates to the Department his or her lack of interest in the permit offered, shall result in the forfeiture of such person's waiting list position and the permit shall be offered to the next person on that borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list.

(b) A person notified of his or her eligibility to apply for a fresh fruits and vegetables permit to vend in a borough not his or her first choice, as that choice was specified on that person's waiting list application, who applies for a permit for such borough and who presents documentation supporting his or her claim of eligibility in one of the preference categories listed in § 17-307(b)(4)(e) of the Administrative Code, if applicable, and whose mobile food unit passes the Department's required inspection pursuant to § 17-307(b)(2)(d) of the Administrative Code, shall not lose his or her waiting list positions(s) on any other borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists of higher choice, as stated on the same waiting list application form. Such fresh fruits and vegetables permittee, however, shall forfeit his or her position(s) on existing borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists of lesser choice as stated on his or her waiting list application form.

(c) Any person notified that their waiting list number on a selected borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list has been reached and who is eligible to apply for this permit but who declines such borough specific permit offer shall be required to forfeit all waiting list positions on any other existing fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists.

(d) Any person who fails to submit documentation satisfactory to the Department demonstrating that such person belongs to a preference category listed in § 17-307(b)(4)(e) or whose mobile food unit does not pass the Department's required inspection, in accordance with § 17-307(b)(2)(d) of the Administrative Code, shall be required to forfeit all such person's waiting list positions on all existing borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists.

(e) The failure of any person to timely apply for a permit offered as specified in this section, complete the Department's inspection process or a person's declination of a specific borough permit offered pursuant to this Chapter, shall not affect that person's standing on any non-fresh fruits and vegetables mobile food unit permit waiting list.






*§ 26-15 Abandonment of Waiting List Position.*


(a)  A person who does not respond within thirty (30) days to a Departmental inquiry concerning a waiting list position held by such person, mailed by ordinary mail to the address provided by such person, shall be deemed to have abandoned such waiting list position. That person shall also be deemed to have abandoned or forfeited his or her standing on any other existing fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list on which he or she may appear.

(b) A person who holds a waiting list position may withdraw his or her name at any time by providing written notice to the Department with verifying documentation satisfactory to the Department.
