Pedestrians already in the roadway must proceed to the nearest safety island or sidewalk in the direction of such signal. Other traffic must yield the right of way to pedestrians proceeding across the roadway within the crosswalk towards such signal for as long as such signal remains flashing.

   (3) Steady upraised hand. No pedestrians shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of such signal; provided, however that any pedestrians who have partially completed their crossing on a steady walking person signal or any flashing upraised hand signal must proceed to the nearest sidewalk or safety island in the direction of such signal while such steady upraised hand signal is showing.

(e) Routes. 

   (1) Operators of empty buses and buses with "charter," "special," "contract carriage" or similar non-route specific authority given by the City of New York, the Department of Transportation, the Interstate Commerce Commission, or other legally authorized body, must adhere to the truck routes as described in 34 RCNY § 4-13, or other additional bus routes, except that an operator may operate on a street not designated as a truck route or bus route for the purpose of arriving at his/her destination. This shall be accomplished by leaving a designated truck route or bus route at the intersection that is nearest to his/her destination, proceeding by the most direct route, and then returning to the nearest designated truck route or bus route by the most direct route. If the operator has additional destinations in the same general area and there is no designated truck route or bus route that can be taken to the next destination, the operator may proceed to his/her next destination without returning to a designated truck route or bus route. The operator shall have in his/her possession throughout each trip a route slip, or similar document, showing the points of origin and destination of the trip. Upon the request of a law enforcement officer, or other authorized person, the bus operator shall present for inspection the above stated document or documents.

   (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of 34 RCNY § 4-10 paragraph (e)(1) above, no operator of a bus as described in paragraph (1) shall operate his/her vehicle upon any of the streets within the area served by the limited local truck route network in Staten Island as described in 34 RCNY § 4-13(c), except for the purpose of arriving at a destination within the area served by the network. This shall be accomplished by using a designated truck route or bus route to the closest limited local truck route to the destination, using this limited local truck route to the intersection that is nearest to the destination. The operator shall then continue via the most direct route to the closest designated limited local truck route and then to the closest designated truck route or bus route. If the operator has additional destinations in the same general area, and there is no designated truck route, limited local truck route, or bus route that can be taken to the next destination, he/she may proceed to his/her next destination without returning to a designated limited local truck route.

(f) Required inspection of buses. No person shall operate or cause to be operated on any street any bus required by law, ordinance, resolution, or rule of any municipal, state, or federal authority to display a certificate, disc, sticker, poster, or other insignia evidencing that such bus has been inspected and is mechanically fit, or has been bonded or insured, or that prescribed fees have been paid, unless such a certificate, disc, sticker, poster or other insignia, currently valid, shall be displayed in the lower right hand corner of the interior surface of the windshield of such bus. In the event it is required that any writing be placed on any such certificate, disc, sticker, poster, or other insignia by someone other than a public official, no person shall operate or move or cause to be operated or moved on any street any such bus unless such writing shall have been placed on such certificate, disc, sticker, poster, or other insignia in black ink and in letters or numbers no less than one inch in height and three-fourths of an inch in width.

(g) Leased and rented buses. No person shall operate or cause to be operated a bus leased, rented, or borrowed from another person unless there is marked on the side of the bus in letters at least three inches in height the words "chartered by" followed by the name of the person operating such leased, rented, or borrowed bus.

(j) Sight-seeing bus stop permit assignment process through random ranking.

   (1) The Commissioner will determine the sightseeing bus stops that will be available for assignment through a random ranking process allowing bus stop applicants to select from the available bus stop locations.

   (2) Applications. An application must be submitted to the Department on a form provided by the Department no later than 5:00 p.m. on the twentieth business day following the publication in the City Record of the Department's intent to assign the bus stops.

      (i) Form. The form to be provided will require, but not be limited to, the following information from applicants:

         (i) Legal name, doing business as certificate, if applicable, address, telephone number, e-mail address, contact person's name;

         (ii) U.S. Department of Transportation numbers, Department of Consumer Affairs License and vehicle inspection report, if applicable;

         (vii) Planned garage or other bus parking locations when the bus is not being used to pick up or drop off passengers.

   (3) The Commissioner will use the following procedure to grant permits to applicants for use of available bus stops:

      (i) Each applicant shall be assigned a rank chosen randomly utilizing a computer generated random number selection program.

      (ii) Applicants will then select from the list of available bus stops in consecutive order based upon their rank.

      (iii) The selected bus stop is then removed from the list of available bus stops and the next ranked applicant will then select from the revised list of available stops.

      (iv) After each applicant has utilized its position in the assigned order, a round is complete. Rounds will continue until each of the available sight-seeing bus stops are distributed.

      (v) The Commissioner will assign the bus stop permit that has been offered when the applicant demonstrates, within 45 days of when the offer was made, that it complies with all applicable licensing requirements. If the applicant does not comply with all applicable licensing requirements, the Department will not offer the applicant the bus stops it selects. If this circumstance arises, the Commissioner may conduct another assignment of available bus stop permits through random ranking of bus operators using the assignment procedure outlined in this paragraph, allowing the operators to select from available bus stop permits.

   (4) Bus stops will not be assigned to a sightseeing bus operator that already holds a bus stop within a three block radius of the bus stop subject to the selection unless the applicant agrees to relinquish the previously assigned bus stop if assigned the new selected bus stop pursuant to this process.

   (5) All applicants receiving bus stops permits must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations related to the operation of sightseeing buses.

   (6) The bus stop permits offered as a result of this process will be for a term of 2 years.

   (7) After one year following the effective date of this Rule, this Rule shall expire and have no further force and effect.

   (2) Use of parkways restricted. Commercial vehicles, pedestrians, horses, limited use vehicles and bicycles are prohibited on parkways.

   (3) Flat tires. No operator shall stop his/her vehicle on the improved or paved roadway of a park or parkway for the purpose of removing or replacing a flat tire. No person shall remove or replace a flat tire unless the vehicle is completely off the improved or paved roadway so that no portion of the vehicle or the person is exposed to passing vehicles.

(b) Restrictions on vehicles.

   (1) Commercial vehicles. Commercial vehicles are prohibited from using any park, except under permit where necessary to make deliveries in such park. Wherever service roads adjoin the main roadway to a park such vehicles are required to use the service roads set apart for such use. In all cases such vehicles must enter the park from the nearest street intersection or entrance, in the direction of traffic, and leave by the nearest intersecting street or exit in the direction of traffic.

   (2) Business or advertising purposes. Vehicles having any name, insignia, or sign painted or displayed thereon for business or advertising purposes are prohibited in parks or parkways except as provided in paragraph (b)(1), above.

   (3) Carriers of offensive refuse or heavy materials. No garbage, ashes, manure, or other offensive material shall be carried through any park. When such refuse is to be removed from premises fronting on any park or improved or paved roadway in a park, the vehicle collecting it must leave the park or improved or paved roadway as soon as the collection has been accomplished, and within the time prescribed by the Commissioner of Parks.

   (4) Buses. No persons shall, except under a permit, drive or operate a bus within any park or on a parkway. Charter buses will be permitted to operate between the shortest possible routes from outside a park to deliver or to pick up their passengers from a picnic, bathing or other recreation area only if a permit to enter the park has been issued to the person sponsoring the outing, picnic, etc. Buses must proceed over the route and to the parking space designated in the permit. Parking in the designated parking space will be limited to the time prescribed in the permit.

   (5) Hearses. No hearse or other vehicles carrying or used for carrying the body of a dead person shall enter or be allowed in any park except by permit.

(c) Restricted areas of parks. No person shall, in any park, drive or operate a vehicle within or upon a safety zone, walk, bridle path or any part of any park designated or customarily used for such purposes. No person shall ride a bicycle, limited use vehicle, or scooter in any park, except in places designated for such riding; but persons may push such machines in single file to and from such places, except on beaches and boardwalks. No person shall ride a limited use vehicle upon any bicycle, pedestrian or bridle path or upon any street or walkway that has been set aside for bicycling while such designation is in effect. No wheelchairs shall be operated in any part of any park unless licensed by the Commissioner of Parks, except that invalids' wheelchairs may be pushed along the boardwalk and pedestrian walks. No person shall ride or lead a horse or other beast of burden in a park, except on a bridle path or along routes customarily used for access to and from bridle paths.

(d) Projecting articles. No person shall operate or drive in any park or parkway a vehicle containing any person or object projecting or hanging outside or on the top thereof; except that outdoor sports and recreation equipment such as skis, ski poles, fishing rods, beach chairs, beach umbrellas, tent poles, toboggans, and sleds may be carried on the rear of such vehicles or on a rack designed for the purpose and attached to the top thereof, provided that in all cases fastenings shall be secure and substantial, and provided that such equipment so carried shall in no case project more than 12 inches above the top or to the rear of such vehicle.

(e) Driving off pavement.

   (1) No vehicle shall be operated or driven off the improved or paved roadways of any park or parkway unless it is disabled.

   (2) All stalled or disabled vehicles must be removed from paved roadways in parks and parkways so as to prevent obstruction of traffic. If not so removed by the owners then they may be removed by Department of Transportation forces or licensed tow operators at the expense of the owners and in such event neither the City nor such licensed tow operators shall be liable for damages caused to such vehicles during removal.

   (3) No disabled vehicle shall be permitted to remain in a park for a longer period than two hours.

(f) Parking. No person shall, in any park area designated as a parking space,

   (1) fail to comply with an order of a law enforcement officer or any park employee or disobey or disregard the notices, prohibitions, instructions or directions on any park sign or parking meter including the Rules of Museums or Zoological or Botanical Gardens, posted on the grounds or buildings of said institutions.

   (2) between one-half hour after sunset and one-half hour before sunrise, stop or park in a vehicle, except at places designated or maintained therefor.






*§ 4-15 Limitations Upon Dimensions and Weights of Vehicles.*


(a) Definitions. 

   (1) Highway. When used in this section, a highway shall mean the entire width between the boundary lines of every public way publicly maintained when any part thereof is open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel and includes any street, avenue, road, square, place, alley, lane, highway, boulevard, concourse, parkway, driveway, culvert, sidewalk, crosswalk, boardwalk, viaduct, underpass and any private street open to public motor vehicle traffic.

   (2) Exception. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any vehicle authorized by the Federal Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, as amended, when such vehicle is operating pursuant to the provisions of such act.

(b) Dimensions and weights of vehicles. No person shall operate or move, or cause or knowingly permit to be operated or moved on any highway or bridge any vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight exceeding the limitations provided for in this subdivision (b).

   (1) Width of vehicle. The width of a vehicle, inclusive of load, shall not be more than eight feet except that the width of school buses and fire vehicles shall not exceed 98 inches and the width of buses having a carrying capacity of more than seven passengers shall not exceed 102 inches.

   (2) Height of vehicle. The height of a vehicle from underside of tire to top of vehicle, including its load, shall not be more than 13 1/2 feet; provided, however, that air cargo carried in containers and pallets loaded onto flatbed trucks that thereby exceed such height may travel between any airport under the jurisdiction of the port of New York authority and off-airport facilities involved in the handling of air cargo located within one mile of such airport on local routes to be designated by the Commissioner. Any such vehicle on such route shall not be required to obtain a permit for such travel.

   (3) Length of single vehicles. The length of a single vehicle, inclusive of load and bumpers shall not be more than 35 feet. The provisions of this paragraph (3) shall not apply to semitrailers, fire vehicles, single unit buses having a capacity of more than fifteen passengers, provided the length of such buses does not exceed 45 feet; or articulated buses provided the length of such bus does not exceed 65 feet. Operators of buses longer than 45 feet in length may be required to demonstrate that on-street stops and terminal areas used by such buses are of sufficient length to accommodate them. In no case shall any bus that has a turning radius greater than 50 feet operate without a permit for such operation issued by the Commissioner;

   (4) Length of combinations of vehicles. The total length of a combination of vehicles, inclusive of load and bumpers, shall not be more than 55 feet, except that the combination of vehicle, load and bumper of vehicles hauling poles, girders, columns or other similar objects of great length which are indivisible, shall not be more than 60 feet. The provisions of this paragraph (4) shall not apply to any fire vehicle or to a vehicle or combination of vehicles that is disabled and unable to proceed under its own power and is being towed for a distance of not more than ten miles for the purpose of repair or removal from the highway. The provisions of this paragraph (4) shall not apply to a combination of vehicles that are operating pursuant to subdivision (j) of this section.

   (5) Number of wheels and axles. In determining the number of wheels and axles on any vehicle or combination of vehicles within the meaning of this subdivision (b), only 2 wheels shall be counted for each axle, and axles that are fewer than 46 inches apart from center to center shall be counted as 1 axle. However, in the case of multiple tires or multiple wheels, the sum of the widths of all tires on a wheel or combination of wheels shall be taken in determining tire width.

   (6) Weight per inch of tire. The weight per inch width of tire of any one wheel of a single vehicle or a combination of vehicles, equipped with pneumatic tires, when loaded, shall not be more than 800 pounds.

   (7) Weight on one wheel. The weight on any one wheel of a single vehicle or a combination of vehicles, equipped with pneumatic tires, when loaded, shall not be more than 11,200 pounds.

   (8) Weight on one axle. The weight on any one axle of a single vehicle or combination of vehicles, equipped with pneumatic tires, when loaded, shall not be more than 22,400 pounds.

   (9) Weight on two axles. The weight on any two consecutive axles of a single vehicle or a combination of vehicles, equipped with pneumatic tires, when loaded, and when such axles are spaced fewer than 10 feet from center to center, shall not be more than 36,000 pounds. Axles shall be counted as provided in paragraph (5) of this subdivision (b).

   (10) Weight on three axles. A single vehicle or a combination of vehicles having 3 axles or more and equipped with pneumatic tires, when loaded, may have a total weight on all axles not to exceed 34,000 pounds, plus 1,000 pounds for each foot and major fraction of a foot of the distance from the center of the foremost axle to the center of the rearmost axle. Axles shall be counted as provided in paragraph (5) of this subdivision (b). In no case, however, shall the total weight exceed 80,000 pounds, except for a combination of vehicles that are operating, pursuant to Subdivision (j)(3) of this section where the total weight shall not exceed 90,000 pounds, without any tolerance for enforcement purposes.

   (11) Weight on solid rubber tires. A vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with any solid rubber tires shall not have a load weighing more than 80% of the total weight permitted in this subdivision (b) for pneumatic tires.

   (12) Width of tires. For the purpose of this subdivision (b), the width of pneumatic tires shall be ascertained by measuring the greatest width of the tire casing when the tire is inflated. The width of solid rubber tires shall be ascertained by measuring the width of the tire base channel or between the flanges of the metal rim. No vehicle equipped with solid rubber tires, which has at any point less than 1 inch of rubber above the top or beyond the flange or rim, shall be operated upon a public highway. The width of metal tires shall be ascertained by measuring the width of contact of the tire with the road surface.

   (13) Weight and height restrictions on bridges, viaducts and other structures. No person shall operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles over, on or through any bridge, viaduct or other structures on any highway if the weight of such vehicle or combination of vehicles and load is greater than the posted capacity of the structure or exceeds the height of the posted clearance as shown by an official sign or other marking or device.

   (14) Other limits also in effect. Nothing m this subdivision (b) shall be construed as preventing the enforcement of rules now in effect or hereafter promulgated by the Department of Transportation further limiting the size and weight of vehicles in designated areas.

   (15) Permits. Upon application in writing showing good cause, the Commissioner may issue a permit to operate or move a vehicle or a combination of vehicles, the weights and dimensions of which exceed the limitations provided for in this subdivision (b), upon any highway under his/her jurisdiction. Every such permit may designate the route to be traversed and may contain any other restrictions or conditions deemed necessary by the Commissioner. Every such permit shall be carried on the vehicle to which it refers and shall be open to the inspection of any law enforcement officer or any inspector of the Bureau of Weights and Measures of the Department of Consumer Affairs of the City of New York. All permits issued shall be revocable by the Commissioner at his/her discretion without a hearing or the necessity of showing cause.

      (i) If an operator of a vehicle with a gross weight of 300,000 pounds or more seeks to cross a bridge under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation of the City of New York, the operator must comply with the following:

         (A) A load rating determined by a New York State licensed Professional Engineer with at least three years experience in the design, inspection and load rating of bridges must be submitted with the permit application. The information contained within such load rating shall include, but is not limited to: (1) the ratings for the inventory and operating level for all structural elements of the bridge so that the critical element of the bridge is identified; (2) the actual weight of the vehicle per axle and the actual axle spacing; and (3) the method used for establishing the capacity of the bridge(s). Load ratings shall be submitted for each bridge on the travel route. Load ratings should conform to "Level 1" load ratings pursuant to New York State Department of Transportation Engineering Instructions for Load Ratings and the latest edition of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Condition Evaluation of Bridges. Each load rating must be stamped and certified by the licensed Professional Engineer who prepared it.

         (B) Within one week from the vehicle's crossover of the bridge(s), the permittee must file a post inspection report of the bridge(s) with the Department. The post inspection report should analyze the structural integrity of the bridge(s), to the Department's satisfaction, as a result of the vehicle's crossover. If the post inspection report indicates any type of distress to the bridge(s), the permittee must rectify the distress and/or damage to the Department's satisfaction. The permittee may submit a pre-inspection report of the bridge's structural integrity for comparison purposes; otherwise the Department will use its latest biennial inspection reports for such purposes. Any pre or post inspection report must comply with the requirements set forth in the latest edition of the New York State Department of Transportation Bridge Inspection Manual. Any distress that is not identified in the pre-inspection report or the biennial inspection reports will be deemed to have been caused by the move.

         (C) Should the permittee fail to comply with any of the requirements contained in this subparagraph, the Commissioner may refuse to issue future overweight and/or overdimensional vehicle permits to the permittee.

      (ii) [Reserved.]

   (16) Permits for vehicles operating pursuant to governmental regulation.

      (i) Where compliance with the requirements of a governmental regulatory agency necessitates exceeding the weight limitations provided herein, a permit may be issued by the Commissioner on application therefor, for a vehicle to exceed such prescribed weight limitations to the extent necessary to meet the governmental regulatory requirements, but in no event shall the allowable total vehicle weight provided herein be exceeded.

      (ii) The application shall include the type of vehicle, the manner and extent to which the weight limitations are to be exceeded, the design details causing such excess and a copy of the governmental regulatory agency requirements.

   (17) Fees. An administrative fee of $35.00 shall be charged for each and every permit issued under this subdivision (b) unless otherwise provided by law. This fee shall not be refundable and is payable in addition to any other fees or charges provided for under the rules of the Department of Transportation.

   (18) Exemptions. 

      (i) Fire Department vehicles. The provisions of this subdivision (b) with respect to the limitations of the weight on axles shall not apply to vehicles of the Fire Department, but in no event shall the allowable total vehicle weight provided hereby be exceeded.

      (ii) Department of Sanitation vehicles. The provisions of this subdivision (b) with respect to the width of a vehicle shall not apply to the sweepers of the Department of Sanitation, provided they do not exceed 11 feet in width.

      (iii) Vehicles working on highways. The provisions of this subdivision (b) with respect to the width of a vehicle shall not apply to vehicles engaged in work on a highway.

(c) Enforcement; measurement and weight of vehicles. Any law enforcement officer or any inspector of the Department of Consumer Affairs of the City of New York having reason to believe that any vehicle or load is in violation of the restrictions in subdivision (b), above, is authorized to stop the vehicle on any public highway or private street open to public motor vehicle traffic and measure and weigh it by means of portable or stationary measures and scales. Any law enforcement officer or such inspector may require that the vehicle be driven to the nearest scales, if they are within 3 miles.

(d) Responsibility for damages. The owner and operator of any vehicle used in the business of a motor carrier, and the carrier, if the vehicle is actually engaged in the conduct of the business, shall be jointly and severally responsible for all damages, to any highway, bridge or culvert resulting from the movement over or under them of any such vehicle that violates any of the weight or size provisions of subdivision (b) above.

(e) Special concrete plant. Upon application in writing and for cause shown, the Commissioner may issue permits to exceed the maximum weight limits provided for in these rules for two- or three-axle vehicles operated in connection with the manufacture or supply of concrete for construction projects located in New York City, provided that such vehicles are registered to or leased by the owner of a manufacturing facility constructed subsequent to January 1, 1986 on land provided by the City for such purposes.

(f) Annual overweight load permit. 

   (1) Permits generally. Except where inconsistent with any federal law, rule or regulation, the Commissioner may issue an annual overweight load permit, as provided in subdivision fifteen of section three hundred eighty-five of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, to expire on the date of expiration of the registration of the vehicle, for any vehicle designed and constructed to carry loads that are not of one piece or item, which vehicle currently is registered in this State and operational on public highways in this State and which was registered in this State and operational on public highways in this State immediately prior to January first, nineteen hundred eight-six, in accordance with the following subparagraphs. The Commissioner also may issue an annual permit to a vehicle or combination of vehicles which replaces a vehicle, which vehicle or combination of vehicles was registered in this State and operational on public highways in this State immediately prior to January first, nineteen hundred eighty-six, provided the manufacturer's recommended maximum gross weight of the replacement vehicle or combination of vehicles does not exceed the weight for which a permit may be issued and the maximum load to be carried on the replacement vehicle or combination of vehicles does not exceed the maximum load which could have been carried on the vehicle being replaced or the registered weight of such vehicle, whichever is lower, in accordance with the following subparagraphs. Motor carriers having apportioned vehicles registered under the international registration plan either must have a currently valid permit as of January first, nineteen hundred ninety-four or shall have designated New York as their base state under the international registration plan in order to be eligible to receive such permit. If a permit holder operates a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of any posted weight restriction, the permit issued to such vehicle or combination of vehicles shall be deemed void as of the next day and shall not be reissued for a period of twelve calendar months; provided, however, that if such violation is adjudicated in favor of the permittee by the New York State Traffic Violations Bureau, the permit shall be reinstated immediately upon presentation of a copy of such judgment to the Commissioner.

      (i) A permit may be issued for a vehicle having at least three axles and a wheelbase not exceeding forty-four feet nor less than seventeen feet or for a vehicle with a trailer not exceeding forty feet. A permit may only be issued for such a vehicle having a maximum gross weight not exceeding seventy-nine thousand pounds and any tandem axle group weight shall not exceed fifty-nine thousand pounds, and any tridem shall not exceed sixty-four thousand pounds.

      (ii) A permit may be issued only until December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine for a vehicle or combination of vehicles that has been permitted within the past four years having five axles and a wheelbase of at least thirty-six and one-half feet. The maximum gross weight of such a vehicle or combination of vehicles shall not exceed one hundred five thousand pounds and any tandem axle group weight shall not exceed fifty-one thousand pounds. A permit may be issued for a vehicle or combination of vehicles having at least five axles and a wheelbase of at least thirty feet. The maximum gross weight of such vehicle or combination of vehicles shall not exceed ninety-three thousand pounds and any tandem axle group weight shall not exceed forty-five thousand pounds and any tridem axle group weight shall not exceed fifty-seven thousand pounds.

      (iii) A permit may be issued for a vehicle or combination of vehicles having at least five axles or more and a wheelbase of at least thirty-six and one-half feet, provided such permit contains routing restrictions. Until December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-four, the maximum gross weight of a vehicle or combination of vehicles permitted under this subparagraph shall not exceed one hundred twenty thousand pounds and any tandem or tridem axle group weight shall not exceed sixty-nine thousand pounds, provided, however, that any replacement vehicle or combination of vehicles permitted after January first, nineteen hundred ninety-five, shall have at least six axles, any tandem axle group shall not exceed fifty thousand pounds and any tridem axle group shall not exceed sixty-nine thousand pounds. After December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-four, the tridem axle group weight of any vehicle or combination of vehicles issued a permit under this subparagraph shall not exceed sixty-seven thousand pounds, any tandem axle group weight shall not exceed fifty thousand pounds and any single axle weight shall not exceed twenty-five thousand seven hundred fifty pounds. After December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine, all vehicles issued a permit under this subparagraph must have at least six axles.

      (iv) A permit may be issued for a vehicle having two axles and a wheelbase not less than ten feet, with the maximum gross weight not in excess of one hundred twenty-five percent of the total weight limitation as set forth in subdivision ten of section three hundred eighty-five of the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law. Furthermore, any axle weight shall not exceed twenty-seven thousand pounds.

   (2) Combination permits.

      (i) Each power unit of a combination of vehicles must have its own annual overweight load permit. A power unit may be used to obtain any number of permits for different combinations of vehicles as long as each permit has a maximum of five trailers per power unit. Only the first permit issued to a power unit pursuant to this paragraph is transferable pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of paragraph three of this subdivision.

(b) The banked weight capacity for any replacement vehicle or combination of vehicles shall not exceed the allowable permitted weight for such replacement vehicle or combination of vehicles, and shall not exceed the gross weight capacity of the replaced vehicle or combination of vehicles. (c) Unused banked weight capacity cannot justify a replacement vehicle or combination of vehicles that has a gross weight capacity greater than the replaced vehicle or combination of vehicles. (d) Any replacement vehicle may be replaced pursuant to the provisions of this section; when a replacement vehicle; has been replaced it becomes ineligible for further annual overweight load permits pursuant to this section.

*§ 7-10 Annual Rate Schedule for Revocable Consent Improvements.*


For all improvements that do not have an annual rate set forth in 34 RCNY § 7-04(a), the annual rate of compensation for the first year of the term of each revocable consent shall be calculated in accordance with the following:

(a) Definitions and variables.

   "A" means the maximum area of the improvement for which a consent has been or is proposed to be granted, as projected onto a horizontal plane (the "footprint").

   "Benefited Property" means the real property which is adjacent to the improvement for which a revocable consent has been or is proposed to be granted, and which is benefited by the improvement.

   "C" means 100 percent plus the percent change (plus or minus) in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers in New York and New Jersey published by the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics ("CPI") on July 1 of the year for which the revocable consent annual rate is being calculated, compared to the CPI on July 1, 2003.

   "E" means the standard escalating factor, which shall be a percentage equal to the average annual percentage increase in the CPI for the ten years immediately preceding the year for which the standard escalating factor is being determined; the Department shall determine the standard escalating factor on July 1 of the year to be applied to all consents granted or renewed between that July 1 and the next succeeding June 30, inclusive.

   "L" means the Current Transitional Assessed Value or the Actual Assessed Value, whichever is lower, of the Benefited Property, in its unimproved state (in dollars and cents per square foot); provided, however, that if there is more than one Benefited Property, "L" shall be equal to the average of the Current Transitional Assessed Values of all the Benefited Properties in their unimproved states (in dollars and cents per square foot). Note: For cables contained within conduit owned by another entity, L=0.

   "M" means the applicable multiplier. For pipes and conduits with up to 25 square feet in cross-sectional area, the applicable multiplier is 0.04. For all other improvements, the applicable multiplier is 0.08.

   "Minimum Annual Charge" shall be assessed as follows: For improvements having a maximum cross-sectional area greater than four square feet, the Minimum Annual Charge shall be $3,000. For improvements having a maximum cross-sectional area of four square feet or less, the Minimum Annual Charge is $1,500, except that pipes and conduits having an outside diameter of three inches or less (inclusive of any protective sheath or casing) shall be assessed a Minimum Annual Charge of $750.

   "R1" means the rate of compensation for the first year of the revocable consent agreement which shall be determined in accordance with 34 RCNY § 7-10(b), below.

   "V" means the rate (in dollars and cents) obtained from Table A relating to the volume occupied by the improvement. For improvements exceeding nine feet in height, the computation will be made in units up to nine feet in height and then added together.

(b) Rate for first year. R1 shall equal C[;V + (L × M × A)];, or the Minimum Annual Charge, whichever is greater.

(c) Rate for each subsequent year.

   second year = R1 + (E × R1)    third year = R1 + (2E × R1)   fourth year = R1 + (3E × R1)   fifth year = R1 + (4E × R1)   sixth year = R1 + (5E × R1)   seventh year = R1 + (6E × R1)   eighth year = R1 + (7E × R1)   ninth year = R1 + (8E × R1)   tenth year = R1 + (9E × R1)

(d)  Consents granted on or prior to June 30, 1991. For those consents granted on or before June 30, 1991 which provide for annual fees to be computed based upon the rate schedule currently in effect, annual compensation shall equal R1 as calculated pursuant to 34 RCNY § 7-10(b).

(e) Revenue. All revocable consent revenue shall be collected by the Department.

Chapter 8: Employee Commute Options Program
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 8-01 Background and Authority.*


Section 182(d)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 7511(a)(d)(1)(B), requires states with severe or extreme nonattainment areas for ozone to revise their state implementation plans by adopting new regulations to reduce work-related vehicle trips and miles traveled by employees. The New York State Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes New York City was designated by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") as a severe ozone nonattainment area, 40 C.F.R. § 81.333. Section 14(31) of the New York State Transportation Law authorizes the State Department of Transportation to promulgate rules and regulations to implement the requirements of § 182(d)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act Amendments and to establish an employee commute options ("ECO") program. The state rules require employers of one hundred or more employees at work locations within severe ozone nonattainment areas in New York State to develop and implement employee trip reduction programs and to make a good faith effort to achieve a twenty-five percent increase in average vehicle occupancy for commuting trips by November 15, 1996. The state transportation law and the rules promulgated pursuant to it also delegate the local administration of the program to counties in the severe ozone nonattainment areas and pursuant to such delegation, the New York City Department of Transportation ("the Department") has been designated the local administrative agency.






*§ 8-02 Applicability.*


This chapter shall apply to any affected employer in the City of New York who is subject to the ECO rules of the New York State Department of Transportation, codified at 17 NYCRR Part 38. This chapter shall apply with respect to any and all affected worksites. Pursuant to 17 NYCRR § 38.4(b)(3), the counties of New York (Region 1) and Bronx, Kings, Queens, and Richmond (Region 2) shall be consolidated into a single region consisting of the subregions identified in table one below.






*§ 8-03 Definitions.*


For purposes of ECO, the definitions set forth in 17 NYCRR Part 38 shall apply; provided, however, that in this chapter, "Commissioner" shall mean the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation and "Department" shall mean the New York City Department of Transportation.






*§ 8-04 AVO Subregions.*


The Average Vehicle Occupancy ("AVO") subregions established pursuant to 17 NYCRR Part 38.4(c) are specified in table one below.






*§ 8-05 Target APOs.*


The specific target Average Passenger Occupancy ("APO") for each subregion is specified in Table one below.

AVO AND TARGET APO METHODOLOGIES

ESTABLISHING AVO VALUES

The 1994 AVO values were established by applying the methodolgy mandated by the New York State Dept. of Transportation Employee Commute Options Regulations. These Regulations require the use of United States Census Journey-to-Work data for 1980 and 1990 to estimate the number of employees and the number of vehicles used to get to work in 1994. The method consists of subtracting 1980 total workers from 1990 total workers, and dividing the result by the number of years (ten, in this case), thereby yielding an "annual change." This "annual change" then is used to project the number of employees for 1994 by adding the "annual change" multiplied by the number of years (four, in this case) to 1990 total workers.

A comparable process is used to estimate the number of vehicles used to get to work. The projected number of workers in 1994 then is divided by the projected number of commuter vehicles in 1994 to establish the 1994 AVO. It is important to note that these projected numbers are not intended to represent actual employment or vehicle numbers for 1994, but are solely for the purpose of establishing an AVO.

ESTABLISHING TARGET APOs

Target APOs are also derived following the methodology mandated by the New York State Regulations. The target APO for the region equals the regional AVO multiplied by 1.25. Reaching the APO target is equivalent to reducing the number of vehicles to the "permitted" number. The "permitted number" of vehicles equals the number of employees at all worksites with 100 or more employees, divided by the target APO. We are required to calculate the number of "permitted" vehicles in order to determine whether achieving Target APOs for all the subregions taken together would reduce the number of commuter vehicles to the level required to meet the APO Target for the region.

Target APOs for each subregion were established by increasing the AVO for each subregion by between 10 and 25%.
