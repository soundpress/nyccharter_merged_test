Chapter 2: Adjudications
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 2-01 Fitness and Discipline Adjudications of Department of Probation Em- ployees.*


New York City Department of Probation adjudications regarding the fitness and discipline of agency employees will be conducted by the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. After conducting an adjudication and analyzing all testimony and other evidence, the hearing officer shall make written proposed findings of fact and recommend decisions, which shall be reviewed and finally determined by the Commissioner of the Department of Probation.




Chapter 1: Procedure For Obtaining Pre-Sentence Reports
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 1-01 Requests for Records.*


The request for such records shall be in writing, indicating the case name and appellate court where pending, submitted by the subject-defendant, counsel on appeal, or the Assistant District Attorney, or by order of the sentencing court or by subpoena and directed to the New York City Department of Probation, Office of the General Counsel, 115 Leonard Street, New York, N.Y. 10013. In order to identify the correct records, the request shall also include the following information:

Defendant's full name.

NYSIS number.

Indictment or Docket number.

County of conviction.

Sentence received, date and name of judge.

The request should also include whenever possible the following:

Aliases used by defendant.

If sentenced to probation, the county and name of supervising officer.

If sentenced to a term of imprisonment, the name and address of the facility where served and the inmate identification number.

Defendant's date of birth.






*§ 1-02 Production of Records.*


(a) Basic procedure. Upon receipt of a proper request, as indicated above, the Department of Probation shall cause three copies of the pre-sentence investigation report to be forwarded to the appropriate appellate court. Said records may then be obtained from the Office of the Clerk of that court. Under no circumstances will the Department of Probation release pre-sentence investigation reports directly to any defendant or attorney. CPL 390.50 provides that probation records are confidential, and are available only for purposes of initial sentencing and upon appeal, and that in those instances "the court shall release" the records.

(b) Time of requests for production. Requests for probation records should be made as far in advance of the date for perfection of the appeal as is possible. Cases which are two or more years old are archived and take a minimum of three to four weeks to locate and forward to the appellate court. Some take longer.

(c) Failure to produce records. It is the responsibility of the requesting party to ascertain whether the probation records have reached the appellate court. No notice will be sent by the Department of Probation. However, if the appellate court indicates that the records have not been received in a reasonable time, further inquiries should be directed either in writing or by telephone to the New York City Department of Probation, Office of the General Counsel, (212) 374-3718, 115 Leonard Street, New York, N.Y. 10013.
