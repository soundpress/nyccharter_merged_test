*§ 1-42 Monitoring Requirements.*


Monitoring requirements and procedures for other than post-abatement clearance air monitoring are as follows:

(a) The sampling zone for air samples shall be representative of the building occupants' breathing zone. However, at no time shall the sampling cassette be placed less than 4 feet from the ground. Air samplers shall be placed so that they are not influenced by unusual air circulation patterns or by the configuration of the space or by each other. Air sampling cassettes shall be mounted upon commercially-available aluminum tripods and shall not be placed within two feet of walls or obstructions such as the corners of rooms or furniture.

(b) If possible, ambient samplers should be placed about 6 feet above the ground surface in reasonable proximity to the building and away from obstructions and drafts that may unduly affect airflow. For outdoor samples, if access to electricity and concerns about security dictate a rooftop site, locations near vents and other structures on the roof which would unduly affect airflow shall be avoided.

(c) Samples shall have a chain of custody record. The project air sampling log required pursuant to 15 RCNY § 1-37(f) does not satisfy the chain of custody requirement.

(d) In accordance with the above criteria, area samples (see 15 RCNY § 1-41) shall conform to the following schedule:

(d) The following aggressive sampling procedures shall be used within the work area during all clearance air monitoring:

   (1) Before starting the sampling pumps, use forced air equipment (such as a 1 horsepower leaf blower) to direct exhaust air against all walls, ceilings, floors, ledges and other surfaces in the work area.

      (i) For asbestos projects: this pre-sampling procedure shall take at least 5 minutes per 1,000 sq. ft. of floor area; then install one 20-inch fan per 10,000 cubic feet of room space. Then immediately place the fan on slow speed and point it toward the ceiling.

      (ii) For pre-demolition asbestos abatement activity, this pre-sampling procedure shall take at least three minutes, after which the 20-inch fan shall be left running unattended in the work area throughout sampling. This procedure shall be acceptable when the floor area of the work area is less than 500 square feet. At or above 500 square feet of floor area within the work area, the aggressive sampling procedures specified in this subdivision (d) for asbestos projects shall be conducted.

   (2) Start the sampling pumps and sample for the required time or volume.

   (3) Turn off the pump and then the fan(s) when sampling is completed.

(e) For post-abatement monitoring, area samples shall conform to the following schedule:

Any leaks detected by the smoke test shall be duct taped airtight.

   (8) If the insulation adjacent to the section which will be worked on is damaged, or if the insulation terminates or is jointed or contains an elbow adjacent to the work section, the adjacent insulation shall be wrapped in fire retardant 6-mil polyethylene sheeting and sealed airtight with duct tape.

   (9) After the insulation has been removed, the surface shall be sprayed with amended water and brush-scrubbed to remove all visible ACM. The surface, the interior of the bag, the insulation and the tools shall then be sprayed with amended water. The enclosed volume shall be misted and time allowed for the mist to settle out before breaking the seal to remove the glovebag.

   (10) Any insulation ends created by this procedure shall be:

      (i) sealed with encapsulant prior to bag removal, or

      (ii) thoroughly wetted before bag removal and sealed with wettable cloth end caps and spray glue or any combination of these materials immediately following bag removal.

   (11) The tool pouch shall be separated from the bag prior to disposal by twisting it and the wall to which it is attached several times, and taping the twist to hold it in place, thus sealing the bag and the pouch which are severed at the midpoint of the twist. Alternatively, the tools can be pulled through with one or both glove inserts, thus turning the gloves inside out. The glove(s) is/are then twist sealed forming a new pouch, taped and several mid-seal forming two separate bags.

   (12) A HEPA vacuum shall be used for evacuation of the glovebag in preparation for removal of the bag from the surface for clean-up in the event of a spill, and for post project clean-up.

*§ 2-08 Performance Testing.*


(a) Performance requirements.

   (1) All installations, including pre-existing equipment, must be required to operate such that upon evaluation of performance tests (as outlined in subdivision (e) below) it is determined that they meet the following minimum requirements:

   (2) When the boiler is fired at 80 to 110 percent of the burner's maximum operational oil/gas delivery rate as specified in the application, provided that this is less than the burner's maximum design oil/gas delivery rate, oil burning installations must have a combustion efficiency of at least 83 percent and gas burning installations must have a combustion efficiency of at least 80 percent. Dual-fuel installations must meet the requirements for each respective fuel.

      Oil fired installations which cannot achieve a combustion efficiency of at least 83 percent but which can achieve a combustion efficiency of at least 80 percent will have no more than one renewal cycle (three years) in which to perform necessary alterations to bring the equipment into compliance. Gas fired installations which cannot achieve a combustion efficiency of at least 80 percent will have one renewal cycle (three years) in which to perform necessary alterations to bring the equipment into compliance.

   (3) When the boiler is fired at 80 to 110 percent of the burner's maximum operational oil/gas delivery rate as specified in the application, provided that this is less than the burner's maximum design oil/gas delivery rate, the maximum acceptable smoke reading must be smoke spot no. 3 in accordance with ASTM International Standard D2156-09.

   (4) When the boiler is fired at 80 to 110 percent of the burner's maximum operational oil/gas delivery rate as specified in the application, provided that this is less than the burner's maximum design oil/gas delivery rate), the installation must be capable of providing adequate pressure differential (e.g., draft) at conditions specified in subdivision (e) of this section.

   (5) For installations which have low-high-low-off or modulating combustion controls, adherence to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2), listed above, must also be demonstrated when the burner is fired at low-fire. For installations which utilize modulating combustion controls, the department requires and reserves the right to verify that the performance requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2), listed above, are also met at intermediate firing rates.

   (6) For multiple boiler installations the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3) and (4), listed above, must be demonstrated for each boiler when said boilers are operated simultaneously rather than individually when there is sufficient load demand from the premise. However, each boiler in a multiple boiler installation, when fired separately (i.e., all other boilers are shut down), must also meet these requirements and the department reserves the right to verify same.

   (7) In no case must the flame impinge on any interior surface within the furnace.

(b) Preparation for performance tests. In order to facilitate implementation of the performance test by the department's engineer, provision must be made by the installer, sufficiently in advance of the scheduled inspection, such that:

   (1) Continuous, uninterrupted operation of the boiler at 80 to 110 percent of the burner's maximum operational oil/gas delivery rate as specified in the application, provided that this is less than the burner's maximum design oil/gas delivery rate, for a minimum period of twenty minutes is insured. Under no circumstances must the boiler pressure relief valve(s) be tampered with to accomplish this.

   (2) Two 3/8 inch diameter holes are provided in the breeching, approximately 4 inches apart and placed so that the one closest to the boiler is approximately one breeching diameter downstream from the boiler outlet. Since these holes must be used for the measurement of boiler outlet gas temperature, percentage of O
										2
										 and smoke reading, it is important that they be placed in the system such that air infiltration from a barometric damper, smoke alarm port, etc., does not affect the composition of the combustion gases.

   (3) Two 3/8 inch diameter holes are provided in the breeching placed one on each side of any power operated draft regulator damper, approximately one breeching diameter from the centerline of the damper. Note that the location of one or both of these holes may, of necessity, be in the boiler outlet.

   (4) All test holes are a minimum of one breeching diameter from any flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion or contraction.

   (5) Any insulation is neatly removed from approximately a 4" × 4" area surrounding any test hole in the breeching.

   (6) All test holes are kept closed with a sheet metal screw or other acceptable method when not being used for testing purposes. All test holes must be marked in such a way that their location can be readily determined.

(c) Performance test equipment. All test data obtained during the performance test must be recorded on a form provided by the department.

(d) Procedure for performance tests. The following is an outline of the procedure which must be used to obtain data necessary for evaluating the performance of an installation and determining whether it meets the requirements specified in subdivision (a), above.

   (1) Verify that all conditions in the boiler room are characteristic of proper operating conditions (i.e., boiler room door is shut, non-fixed ventilation sources such as windows are shut, etc.).

   (2) The burner must be started up and operated at 80 to 110 percent of the burner maximum operational oil/gas delivery rate as specified in the application, provided that this is less than the burner's maximum design oil/gas delivery rate, depending on the demand load throughout the sequence of steps specified in paragraph (4) below.

   (3) The probe(s) of the testing equipment must be inserted into the test holes provided at the required locations.

   (4) Commencing after burner startup, boiler outlet gas temperature must be read at one minute intervals until the difference between two successive readings is not greater than 5°F at which time steady state conditions will be assumed and the following data must be obtained and recorded:

      (i) The boiler outlet gas temperature must be determined. In addition, the ambient air boiler room temperature in the vicinity of the burner must be determined.

      (ii) The percent oxygen (O
										2
										) in the flue gas must be determined.

      (iii) The pressure differential across the damper of a power operated draft regulator must be determined. This is not applicable to condensing boilers.

         (A) The pressure differential measurements and the gas temperature and outside ambient air temperature measurements must be used to determine whether adequate pressure differential (e.g., draft) can be provided when outside ambient air temperature is 94F.

         (B) When a power operated draft regulator is used, the pressure differential measured across the damper must be equal to or greater than the value obtained when the height of the stack (H) is multiplied by ΔDr/H, i.e.

            ΔP ≥ H × (ΔDr/H)

            where,

               ΔP (inches H
										2
										O) is the pressure differential measured across the power operated draft regulator damper.

               ΔDr/H (inches H
										2
										O/ft) is the differential draft per foot obtained from Table I using the outside ambient temperature measured when the performance test was conducted.

               H (feet) is the height of the stack.

         (C) When a barometric or manual damper is used, the theoretical pressure differential caused by the barometric or manual damper must be equal to or greater than the value obtained when the height of the stack is multiplied by ΔDr/H, i.e.

            ΔP ≥ H × (ΔDr/H)

            where ΔP, ΔDr/H, and H are defined in (B).

The static pressure is measured at the boiler outlet. The barometric damper or manual damper is gradually opened until the calculated DP is measured. The barometric damper is then returned to its original setting and the manual damper is then returned to its initial position and fixed. The department will review alternative demonstrations of adequate pressure differential if they comply with 2009 ASHRAE Fundamentals Chapter 21, and are stamped by a professional engineer.

   (5) The smoke reading must be determined and recorded in accordance with ASTM D2156 (2009).

   (6) For boilers which have low-high-low-off or modulating controls, upon completion of the above sequence of steps, the burner firing rate must be changed to low-fire for all boilers with a maximum heat input rating greater than 4.2 million Btu per hour.

   (7) Dual-fuel burners will be tested separately for oil and gas on high fire and on low-fire if the maximum heat input rating is greater than 4.2 million Btu per hour.

   (8) For multiple boiler installations, all boilers must be started up and operated simultaneously at 80 to 110 percent of their respective maximum operational oil/gas delivery rates as specified in the application, provided that this is less than the burner's maximum design oil/gas delivery rate, and the boiler outlet gas temperature, boiler room ambient air temperature, percentage of O
										2
										, smoke reading, and pressure differential must be determined for each boiler. The burner firing rates for all boilers must then be changed to their respective low-fire firing rates, and the boiler outlet gas temperature, boiler room ambient air temperature, percentage of O
										2
										 in the flue gas, and smoke reading, must be determined for each boiler at this firing rate.

(e) Evaluation. The boiler outlet gas temperature, boiler room air temperature, percentage of O
										2
										 in the flue gas, draft measurement, and smoke reading data must be used to determine whether the installation meets the minimum performance requirements for combustion efficiency, adequate reserve draft and smoke reading.

   (3) The following procedure must be followed in the use of the combustion analyzer:

      (i) Set up the combustion analyzer per manufacturer's instructions. In uncontaminated air (outdoor) start the analyzer and allow unit to complete the zeroing process. Never allow the analyzer to zero in the breeching.

      (ii) Verify that the combustion analyzer condensate/water trap plug/access is properly sealed, that there is no water in the water trap, and thermocouple tip is not touching the side of probe tube. The test and record measurement criteria must be provided on a form prescribed by the department.

(c) This section applies to registrations that are subject to the requirements of 15 RCNY § 2-01.








*§ 2-10 [Reserved]*


(a) General considerations.

   (1) All equipment and apparatuses, in addition to complying with the requirements of the department, must also meet the requirements of other agencies, such as the New York City Board of Standards and Appeals, the Fire Department of New York, and the New York City Department of Buildings. Compliance with any requirements of either New York State or federal rules and regulations that may be instituted and not covered here is required. In the absence of any regulatory provisions, consideration must be given to recommendations published in the standards of nationally recognized organizations. These organizations include the American National Standards Institute, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Gas Institute, Underwriters' Laboratories, and the National Fire Protection Association, and the recommendations of equipment or apparatus manufacturers.

   (2) The design engineer must estimate the heat demand before selecting a boiler or boilers. When application is made for an installation for a new structure or for a replacement boiler (when the boiler maximum heat input rating size is increased by more than 20 percent from the previously filed application of record), the analysis and calculations for estimating the heat demand must be submitted in a form acceptable to the department. This must be done in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the 2009 ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook, or as required for the New York City Energy Conservation Code, as codified in Chapter 10 of Title 28 of the New York City Administrative Code, and as accepted by the department.

   (3) For dual-fuel installations using #6 or #4 fuel oil as a back-up fuel for natural gas, design requirements set forth by the department must be followed. However, these installations must still meet the #2 fuel oil emission standards and must be held to the most recent performance requirements.

(b) Fuel burners.

   (1) An oil burner must be capable of atomizing the oil by properly mixing it with adequate combustion air. A gas-fired burner must be capable of mixing the gas with adequate combustion air.

   (2) A new burner must be listed by UL, CSA Group, ETL, or any other national recognized testing laboratory that uses UL testing conditions and have their Listing Mark label.

   (3) A new burner, except for atmospheric equipment, must have, integral with it, a fan which is capable of supplying all combustion air.

   (4) A burner must be sized such that, when fired with a boiler, the fuel delivery rate is within 80 percent and 110 percent of the maximum heat input rating of the boiler.

(c) Fresh Air Requirements.

   (1) Provision must be made to provide a sufficient amount of air for proper combustion (to the oil-or natural gas-burning equipment room) and, in addition, a sufficient amount of bypass air necessary for the proper operation of a barometric damper when used. In addition, sufficient air must be provided to adequately ventilate the room and maintain the ambient temperature at safe and comfortable limits under normal conditions of use. In all cases a separate ventilation system must be provided independent of any other ventilation system.

      (i) Mechanical ventilation must be designed such that 226 cfm @ 94F is provided for each million Btu per hour for up to 30 percent excess combustion air. Larger fan capacities would be needed for installations operating with greater than 30 percent excess combustion air. In all cases, where the combustion air is not ducted directly from the outside to the burner air intake, the room in which the burning equipment is located must be maintained at a pressure not less than outside atmospheric pressure. Exhaust fans are acceptable for ventilation provided the net ventilation is greater than or equal to the amount required for combustion.

      (ii) When mechanical ventilation is not utilized, the minimum requirement for combustion air entrance must be a louvered opening in a wall to the outside air. The louvered opening must have a net free area of 86 square inches for every one million Btu per hour (based on the maximum heat input rating) and must never be less than the average internal cross-sectional area of the chimney. In addition, the net free area of the louver must be increased in size equivalent to the opening of a barometric damper or dampers, when provided, for bypass air. When necessary, a metal grate over a vault below the sidewalk may be permitted as long as the net free area requirement is met and suitable drainage facilities are provided. The net free area when the actual louver efficiency is unknown must be based on a maximum efficiency of 60 percent for both motorized and fixed metal single vane louvers and 50 percent for fixed metal double vane louvers. Where the efficiency of the louver can be demonstrated by the manufacturer to be greater than the above, the greater value may be used. The area of the louver is to be based on the inside frame dimensions and not the outside or nominal dimensions. The louver must be so constructed or suitably located or protected (i.e., cinder blocks, metal bars) so that it cannot be crushed or deformed since this would diminish the free area. Furthermore, any reduction of free area due to protective devices must be considered. Screening over louvers, if provided, must be not smaller than 1/4 inch mesh and must be readily accessible for cleaning.

      (iii) When ducts are required to provide fresh air, they must meet the same minimum requirement for cross-sectional area as specified in subparagraph (ii) above. Note that a louver is not required where ducts are utilized to provide ventilation, although, consideration should be given to protective devices and any diminution of free area resulting from same. Access ports must be provided for the purpose of cleaning and observing conditions within the duct(s). All access ports must be ample size, but not less than 8 × 8 inches. A tight metal fitting cover must be provided for each port. All ports must be closed when not in use.

         (A) Access ports for cleanout must be located to allow accessibility to all duct sections and must be placed at intervals to allow for safe and reasonable access to all sections of the breeching for the purposes of cleaning. The number of clean-outs must be determined by the configuration of the duct lay-out. Every duct must be provided with at least one access port for cleanout.

         (B) Access ports for observation purposes must be provided within one diameter of all internal dampers.

         (C) One access port may be used to serve both functions if suitably located.

      (iv) Motorized louvers or motorized dampers in ducts must be provided, on installations where the maximum heat input rate of the boiler(s) is 7.0 million Btu per hour or greater which must close off the admission of combustion air during burner-off periods.

   (2) Breeching must be installed so as to vent the combustion gases from the boiler to the chimney.

      (i) Access ports must be provided for the purpose of cleaning and observing conditions within the breeching. All access ports must be of ample size but not less than 8 × 8 inches. A tight fitting metal cover must be provided for each port. All ports must be closed when not in use.

         (A) Access ports for the cleanout of oil burning installations must be located to allow accessibility to all breeching sections and must be placed at intervals to allow for safe and reasonable access to all sections of the breeching for the purposes of cleaning. The number of clean-outs must be determined by the configuration of the breeching lay-out. Every breeching must be provided with at least one access port for cleanout.

         (B) For short breeching runs (less than 15 feet in total), the barometric damper may be used as the clean-out port.

         (C) Access ports for observation purposes must be provided within one diameter of all internal motorized damper locations.

         (D) One access port may be used to serve both functions if suitably located.

      (ii) The following should be considered when designing a new breeching:

         (A) The equivalent inside diameter should normally be no smaller than the outlet of the boiler and should be sized on the basis of maintaining a flue gas velocity not greater than 30 feet per second.

         (B) Breechings should be as short and straight as possible to prevent unnecessary draft losses (which may necessitate larger chimneys, induced draft fans, etc.).

         (C) Breechings should be constructed so that changes in direction, shape and cross-sectional area are accomplished separately. All such changes should be accomplished as gradually as possible to eliminate turbulence with consequent adverse effects on available draft. If the width of breeching is greater than the inside width of the chimney, a contoured transition piece should be installed. The transition section should maintain the area of the breeching while altering its configuration so as not to exceed the chimney width.

         (D) The breeching connection to the chimney should be such that it ends flush with the inside surface of the chimney.

   (3) Chimneys must be designed and installed so as to vent the products of combustion to the atmosphere while at the same time avoiding a potential or actual nuisance. Chimneys must not be fitted with raincaps or covers of any kind.

      (i) New chimneys or reconstructed chimneys must be of tight construction and must be provided with a cleanout chamber at the base. The chamber must have a horizontal cross-sectional area equal to that of the chimney and must be equipped with a tightly fitted metal door of ample size but not less than 8 × 8 inches. The bottom of the breeching must be located at least one chimney diameter above the base of the cleanout chamber. Factory-made chimneys and special gas vents must be installed per the manufacturer's specifications.

(d) Control devices.

   (1) A boiler must be provided with acceptable control device(s) so as to maintain the desired boiler output under all normal operating conditions to meet the minimum performance requirements described in 15 RCNY § 2-08.

   (2) A burner must be provided with acceptable control device(s) so as to maintain the desired fuel-air ratio under all normal operating conditions to assure complete and smokeless combustion.

   (3) The burner control system must be permanently interlocked, unless the system is continuously staffed and supervised, with all ventilation fans, motorized louvers and dampers to prevent operation of the burner without the proper operation of the fan, louver, or damper. This must be accomplished with an air switch, or other approved means, to assure that the fan is operating or that the louver/damper has opened before the main fuel valve opens. This requirement does not prohibit operating fans and opening louvers or dampers for ventilation purposes during periods when the burner(s) are not in operation, although continuous, uninterrupted operation of the fan, independent of the burner, must not be permitted except for existing central ventilation systems.

   (4) Provision must be made, concerning the burner fan, to cause minimum pre-purge and post-purge periods as recommended by the burner manufacturer to prevent accumulation of unburned oil.

(e) Draft Regulators.

   (1) All installations must be designed such that an adequate draft can be maintained to provide sufficient combustion air and remove the products of combustion under normal conditions of use or when the outside temperature varies between 11°F and 94°F.

   (2) Power operated draft regulators must be of an acceptable type designed to maintain a safe damper opening at all times and arranged to prevent starting of the burner unless the damper is opened to a safe position. The damper must be sized so that it comprises the full cross-sectional area of the breeching with appropriate allowances for clearance. Upon shut-down of the burner the damper must go to a safe closed position. The axis-rod (i.e., control rod) about which the damper rotates must have a square cross section or if round, must be welded to the control arm. An arrow must be provided on the axis-rod to indicate the position of the damper.

   (3) Draft sensing lines must be a minimum of 1 1/4 inch pipe size, installed through the furnace wall, provided with a full size cleanout plug, and must otherwise conform to the equipment manufacturer's specifications. Details concerning the length and diameter of the draft sensing lines must be shown on the plans or specified in the plan notes.

   (4) Barometric dampers must be of an acceptable type designed so as to provide a constant draft at a point directly upstream of the barometric damper under all normal operating conditions or when the outside temperature varies between 11°F and 94°F. However, in no case under steady state conditions must a pressure exist in the breeching at the barometric damper which is greater than the boiler room pressure. The minimum cross-sectional opening of the barometric damper must be at least as large as the diameter or equivalent diameter of the breeching to which it is connected.

   (5) A draft control must not be required where an acceptable boiler assembly is designed and installed according to the manufacturer's requirements, and a positive pressure exists at a location in the chimney within three diameters of the chimney outlet.

   (6) A boiler must be provided with acceptable control device(s) so as to maintain adequate draft (positive or negative as required) necessary for proper gas flow both to supply sufficient combustion air and exhaust combustion gases under all normal load and atmospheric conditions.

      (i) A separate draft control must be provided for each boiler and be of the same type and must be installed per the manufacturer's specifications.

      (ii) Draft control must be accomplished by a power operated draft regulator with low-draft cut-off. A barometric damper may be substituted for a power operated draft regulator if

         (A) an on-off or low-high-off with low-fire start combustion controller is used or

         (B) a forced draft burner is used.

   (7) Oil-fired equipment, including dual-fuel installations, must be provided with a smoke alarm and combustion shutoff. This equipment must conform to the following specifications as well as applicable sections of the Air Pollution Control Code: The requirements of the above paragraph must not apply to a temperature controlled dual-fuel system (as set forth below) when the maximum heat input rate is less than 4.2 million Btu per hour. A temperature controlled dual-fuel system must comprise a fuel burning installation capable of burning natural gas and #2 fuel oil. The system must be designed and must operate such that the fuel burned will normally be gas except that when the outdoor temperature drops below 20°F, the equipment will automatically switch to #2 fuel oil and when the outdoor temperature rises above 25°F, the equipment will automatically return to natural gas operation.

      (i) The smoke alarm must be regulated for both brightness intensity of the light source and sensitivity of the detector. It is recommended that the light source have a relatively uniform intensity over a reasonably long life.

      (ii) The smoke alarm must cause both an audible (loud enough to be heard 20 feet from the source) and readily visible (a flashing red light) signal upon the emission of an air contaminant of an opacity of 20 percent or greater.

      (iii) The smoke alarm must activate an additional signaling device located at the principal work location of the person supervising the equipment. If there is no principal work location, the additional signaling device must be located at an acceptable alternate location outside the boiler room.

      (iv) The smoke alarm must cause the signaling devices to be activated in the event that the light source in a photoelectric type detector fails to operate properly. The signals must continue until the unit is manually reset.

      (v) The smoke alarm must be provided with a suitable metal grid or equivalent, which meets the manufacturer's recommendations, calibrated so that when placed in the light path of the detector it will cause a response equivalent to an air contaminant as described in subparagraph (ii) above. This calibration must be indicated on the grid holder or frame. This grid must be securely fastened by means of a welded link chain of suitable length to the body of the detector. Provision must be made to temporarily hang the grid in front of the sensing element of the detector to facilitate proper adjustment of the light source and calibration of the instrument.

      (vi) The installation of the smoke alarm must be such that

         (A) it is wired to function at all times and

         (B) it includes means necessary for sealing the breeching to prevent blowout of combustion products when necessary.

      (vii) If two or more units of equipment are connected to a single flue, one air contaminant detector may be used if installed to monitor all of the units. This arrangement, however, will result in the shut-down of all units of equipment upon activation of the combustion shutoff.

      (viii) The combustion shutoff automatically halt the operation of equipment within two minutes of continuous emission of an air contaminant of a density which appears as dark or darker than 20 percent opacity, unless the system is continuously staffed and supervised. The combustion shutoff must be designed such that once it has been activated, the equipment cannot resume normal operation without manual reset.








*§ 2-12 [Reserved]*


Several factors affect the location of the chimney outlet including the need to avoid a potential or actual nuisance. The following applicable requirements must be met.

(a) For all new installations (new building or new chimney):

   (1) The chimney must extend above all construction such as roof ridge, parapet wall, penthouse, roof tank, elevator enclosure, etc., as follows:

      (i) Chimneys must extend at least 3 feet above said construction located within 10 feet of the chimney outlet.

   (2) The chimney outlet must not be located within the minimum radial distance specified in Table II.

(b) For existing installations:

   (1) The chimney must extend at least as high as all construction such as roof ridge, parapet wall, penthouse, roof tank, elevator enclosure, etc., within 10 feet of the chimney outlet.

   (2) The chimney outlet must not be located within the minimum radial distance specified in Table II. Such requirement must apply to receptors which are at a height equal to or greater than the chimney outlet.

      For receptors located below the chimney outlet, the chimney outlet must not be located within the minimum radial distance specified in Table II.

      In those instances where the above is applicable, the following statement must be provided as a plan note in place of the statement required in 15 RCNY § 2-04(c)(2)(iv) - (vi): "The minimum radial distance from the centerline of the existing chimney to an acceptable receptor location (a) located at a height equal to or greater than the chimney outlet is ________ ft. and (b) located below the chimney outlet is ________ ft.," with the distance specified.

(c) Whenever a building is erected, enlarged, or increased in height so that any receptor location in such building is within the minimum radial distance, as specified in Table II, of any previously constructed chimneys, the owner of such new or altered building must have the responsibility of altering such chimneys to make them conform with subdivision (a) of this section above. This must not apply to chimneys no longer connected to combustion equipment.

(d) 1) The criteria employed in determining stack heights and chimney outlet to receptor distance in this section must only apply to off-site receptors.

   (2) Receptors, sources and geometry with the following features will be considered on-site and not subject to 15 RCNY § 2-13.

      (i) A single boiler stack servicing a single building structure.

      (ii) Contiguous construction (i.e., attached "row" houses).

      (iii) Separate entrances with separate addresses all serviced by the same boiler room.

   (3) This section will be applied to existing facilities to the maximum extent possible consistent with good engineering practices. Alternative and less costly options to altering the stack should be permitted if it can be shown that this will not cause degradation of boiler performance. Degradation of boiler performance would increase air pollutant emissions or inhibit compliance with boiler upgrading criteria.

   (4) For new and existing chimneys, emission impacts upon sensitive receptors including, but not limited to, windows, doors that open, people, and building fresh air intakes must be minimized by employing good air pollution control engineering practices. Such practices include, without limitation:

      (i) Avoiding locations that may be subject to downwash of the exhaust; and

      (ii) Installing stacks of sufficient height in locations that will prevent and minimize flue gas impacts upon sensitive receptors.

   (5) Since this chapter's tables were developed using assumed average meteorological conditions in New York City, situations being disputed may be resolved by the submission of individualized computations of pollutant concentration at the receptor using realistic and applicable factors in dispersion models recommended and approved by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the federal Environmental Protection Agency. The modeling must show that National Ambient Air Quality Standards will not be exceeded at any sensitive receptors, including openable windows and fresh air intakes. The tests, modeling, analysis and costs for these study(s) must be the responsibility of the applicant.

   (3) An owner who holds a certificate of operation or a registration for a boiler and/or burner that uses #2 oil, #4 oil, #6 oil and/or natural gas, and who seeks to make an in-kind replacement for use with #2 oil, #4 oil and/or natural gas is not required to file a new application for a work permit and a subsequent certificate of operation or a registration. The owner must provide on a form to be designated by the commissioner the make, model and serial number of the replacement equipment. The previously issued certificate of operation or a registration may be renewed with the previously issued application number assigned by the department upon approval of the amendment by the department.

   (4) An owner who holds a certificate of operation or a registration for a boiler and/or burner and who seeks to replace the boiler and/or burner with equipment that is not of the same make and model number must file a new application for a work permit and a subsequent certificate of operation or a registration as provided in 15 RCNY §§ 2-04 and 2-05. The previously issued certificate of operation or a registration for the previously installed equipment will be cancelled upon receiving the application. The department will not accept an amendment to the previously issued certificate of operation or a registration for such replacement of the equipment.

(c) New Installations (Replacement).

   (1) All applications for a work permit or a registration for a boiler and/or burner must specify that the equipment uses #2 oil and/or natural gas, unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the particulate matter and NOx emissions of the #4 oil and/or #6 oil to be used in such boiler and/or burner will be equivalent to or less than the emissions from #2 oil as provided in paragraph 4 of subdivision (a) of this section.

   (2) In cases where a work permit has been issued before the effective date of this rule for a boiler and/or burner that uses #4 oil or #6 oil, but where a certificate of operation or a registration has not yet been issued, the owner of the equipment must file an amendment specifying the use of #2 oil and/or natural gas, unless the owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the particulate matter and NOx emissions of the #4 oil and/or #6 oil to be used in such boiler or burner will be equivalent to or less than the emissions from #2 oil as provided in paragraph 4 of subdivision (a) of this section.

(d) Sunset Provision. Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, after January 1, 2030, all applications for a certificate of operation or a registration for a boiler and/or burner must specify that the equipment uses #2 oil and/or natural gas, unless (i) the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the particulate matter and NOx emissions of the #4 oil or #6 oil to be used in such boiler and/or burner will be equivalent to or less than emissions from #2 oil as provided in paragraph 4 of subdivision a of this section, or, (ii) the applicant is an owner of fifty or more buildings with boilers or burners that use #4 oil or #6 oil, and enters into a compliance agreement with the commissioner in accordance with subdivision (e) of this section.

(e) Compliance Agreements.

   (1) A compliance agreement entered into under subdivisions b and d of this section must include a schedule agreed to by the commissioner for the conversion and/or replacement of boilers and/or burners, and/or demonstration of the required equivalency, until the owner is in full compliance with the provisions of this section.

Chapter 3: Cessation of Operation and Removal and Sealing of Refuse Burning Equipment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 3-01 Cessation of Operation and Removal and Sealing of Refuse Burning Equipment.*


(a) Prohibition.

   (1) Purusant to Local Law 39 of 1989, effective June 28, 1993, all owners of refuse burning equipment shall cease the operation of and remove and seal such refuse burning equipment.

   (2) Compliance with prohibition. All such owners shall comply with the prohibition set forth in subdivision (a)(1) by either removal of all auxiliary burners and sealing of all doors to refuse burning equipment, or by conversion of the charging chute for such refuse burning equipment to a refuse chute in accordance with all applicable Department of Buildings laws and rules. For the purposes of this paragraph "sealing" means the removal of incinerator grates and compliance with subdivision (e) of 1 RCNY § 24-01 of Chapter 24 of the Rules of Department of Buildings of the City of New York governing fireproofing.

   (3) Unless otherwise required by law, no owner of refuse burning equipment shall be required to install a refuse compacting system upon the cessation of operation and the removal and sealing of such refuse burning equipment.

(b) Request for change in Department of Sanitation collection service.

   (1) If, as a result of the cessation of operation and removal and sealing of refuse burning equipment, the owner of a residential building which contains such equipment and currently receives Department of Sanitation collection service determines that a change from its existing form of collection service (e.g., curbside or containerized collection) is necessary, he/she shall notify the Department of Sanitation in writing no later than June 28, 1993. Such notice shall be addressed to the New York City Department of Sanitation, Office of Collection and Containerization, 125 Worth Street, Room 821A, New York, New York 10013, and shall provide:

      (i) The type of collection service the building is presently receiving (i.e., curbside or containerized). Curbside collection service means placing garbage receptacles at the curb which are then manually serviced by Department of Sanitation personnel. Containerized collection service means placing garbage bags/refuse into a container(s) in an area accessible to a Department of Sanitation mechanized collection vehicle. The owner of the building currently receiving Department of Sanitation collection service shall state whether he/she request: (A) continuation of containerized collection service, or eligibility to receive containerized service; or (B) continuation of curbside collection service, all requests are subject to Department of Santation approval based on availability of collection equipment, facilities, necessary support resources and operational feasibility; and

      (ii) Proof of Legal Authorization and Occupancy for Building. The owner of a building currently receiving Department of Sanitation collection shall submit a copy of the Certificate of Occupancy for such building, or, if such building is not legally required to operate pursuant to a Certificate of Occupancy, a notarized statement from the building owner stating the number of stories the building contains and the number of families authorized by law to occupy the building.

   (2) Upon the Department of Sanitation's receipt of the information set forth in subdivision (1) of this section, a Department of Sanitation representative shall visit the subject residential building and determine whether the request for change in collection service should be granted.

Chapter 8: Industrial Equipment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 8-01 Submission of Environmental Rating Reports from Industrial Sources.*


Environmental Rating Reports are required for every industrial process capable of emitting solid, liquid or gaseous contaminants to the open air, and are required regardless of when the equipment became operational. The Department requires that all operational industrial equipment, as defined in § 24-104(25) of the Administrative Code, in New York City submit an Environmental Rating Report pursuant to § 24-154 of the Code. The Environmental Rating Report is required to contain substantive information showing that the equipment is being operated in compliance with § 24-153 of the Code. The Environmental Rating Reports must be filed with the Bureau of Air Resources when specifically requested by the Bureau, and/or upon application for renewal of a Certificate of Operation if an Environmental Rating Report was not previously submitted. In accordance with § 24-138 of the Code an administrative fee must be submitted with the Environmental Rating Report. No fee is required if the Report is filed in support of an application for an operating certificate. Environmental Rating Reports are not required for oil or gas burners and boilers, unit space heaters, and exhausts used for comfort heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems. Any owner or operator who is unsure whether an Environmental Rating Report should be filed should complete and submit Form AR 510 to the Bureau of Air Resources. No fee is required when filing Form AR 510. The Bureau of Air Resources will notify the owner or operator within 60 days of filing Form AR 510 if an Environmental Rating Report must be submitted.




Chapter 9: Gas Fired Burner Installations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 9-01 Installation of and Conversion to Gas or Gas/Oil Fired Burners.*


(a) For those installations where it is necessary to install a new gas or gas/oil burner then a complete new filing will be required.

(b) For those installations for which the Department of Environmental Protection has an application to use oil as a fuel and a decision is made to convert to straight gas, an amendment to the filing is required which must show compliance with subdivision (e) of this section.

(c) For those installations for which the Department has an application to use oil as a fuel and a decision is made to convert to a combination of oil and gas, and amendment to the active filing is all that is required provided the burner is accepted for both gas and oil firing. It should be understood that the installation will be required to meet the Engineering Criteria for Oil Burning Equipment for the grade of oil being used.

(d) For those installations which have a valid Certificate of Operation under current criteria for fuel oil and a decision is made to convert to straight gas or gas and oil and the burner for which the Certificate of Operation was issued is accepted for burning gas or gas and oil, than an amendment to the original application will suffice to document the change in the grade of fuel. It should be noted however, that in those cases where oil is burned in combination with gas, that the grade of oil must be the same or a lighter grade than that for which the Certificate of Operation was issued.

(e) In all of the above cases, it will be the responsibility of the filing engineer to advise the owner that an appropriate filing is required in the Department of Buildings. A copy of the Letter of Completion from the Building Department must be submitted. Same will be accepted in lieu of burner labeling by Underwriters Laboratories and will not require inspection by the Bureau of Air Resources with reference to modification on burner, but we may require inspection on the boiler for compliance with Chapter 2 of these Rules. There will be no requirement to update the UL label to indicate oil/gas operation.

(f) Whenever an application is filed for natural gas, the application will be required to meet the criteria in effect on June 30, 1973 (Chapter 2 of these Rules).* Where this criteria refers to natural gas, the specific requirements for natural gas will be used, in all other cases, the requirements for number 2 fuel oil will be used on an equivalent BTU basis as has been the policy in the past.

Vapor barriers can be constructed of polyvinyl chloride, PVC sheet 22 mil thick (0.022 in.), sheet metal, metal foil face composite board, or other equivalent materials that are impermeable to perc vapors. Vapor barriers must be constructed so that all joints and seams are sealed except for inlet makeup air and exhaust openings and entry doors. Entry doors may only be open when a person is entering or exiting the room enclosure.

   (2) General exhaust ventilation system. Dry cleaning facilities which are co-located must be equipped with a vapor barrier and with a general exhaust ventilation system that is completely separate from the ventilation system(s) serving other areas of the building. The general exhaust ventilation system must be located near the dry cleaning machinery or connected to a separate room enclosure with a vapor barrier exhausting emissions to the outer air. The system shall be designed and operated to maintain a negative pressure in the room enclosure whenever the dry cleaning machine(s) is operating. This dry cleaning general exhaust ventilation system must be operated at all times when the dry cleaning machine(s) is in operation, and during maintenance operations and must be capable of at least one air change per five minutes.

   (3) Door fan/local exhaust ventilation systems.

      (i) All first, second and third generation dry cleaning equipment must be equipped with a door fan/local exhaust ventilation system. This system must include a mechanical exhaust fan that is activated when the loading door is open, drawing air from the machine drum causing fresh air to be drawn in through the loading door. A minimum inward air velocity of 100 fpm, must be maintained through the effective door opening area of the loading door of the machine.

      (ii) Door fan/local exhaust ventilation systems must not recirculate vapors into the workroom and must be properly vented to the outer air.

   (4) Process Ventilation Emissions – Interim Standards.

      (i) Process ventilation emission points on first and second generation machines that exhaust during the aeration cycle and when the machine door is open must be vented to the outer air above the roof and more than 25 feet from all openings in nearby occupancies.

      (ii) Process ventilation emissions from existing first and second generation vented machines having emission controls as part of the original equipment or retrofitted to comply with the 100 ppm perc emission standard effective May 10, 1981 under the repealed version of Title 6, Part 232 of Codes, Rules, and Regulations of the State of New York must continue to meet this standard until such time as retrofitting, replacement, or shutdown is required under this section.

      (iii) Process ventilation emissions from existing second generation machines that are retrofitted with control equipment to comply with interim standards established under (b)(3) or (b)(6) in this section must be designed to achieve a perc concentration of five ppm or less in the exhaust and achieve an in-use compliance standard of less than 20 ppm perc in the exhaust.

      (iv) The exhaust damper of a vented first or second generation machine must be completely closed when the machine is not being vented, and must not leak vapors into the workroom or the outer air.

   (5) Primary emission control systems. Refrigerated condensers or equivalent closed-loop vapor recovery systems must meet the following requirements:

      (i) Refrigerated condensers must be capable of achieving an outlet vapor temperature downstream of any by-pass of the condenser less than or equal to 45°F (7.2°C) during the final cool down cycle, and achieve a concentration of 8600 ppm or less perc in the drum upon completion of the drying cycle.

      (ii) Refrigerated condensers must have a graduated thermometer, thermocouple or equivalent instrument with a minimum range from 0°F (-18°C) to 150°F (66°C), that measures the temperature of the outlet vapor stream downstream of any by-pass of the condenser, and is easily visible to the operator.

      (iii) New third and fourth generation equipment with refrigerated condenser control systems must be equipped with a drying sensor/controller that extends the drying time at least four minutes beyond the point that the solvent recovery rate is less than 40 ml/min or solvent vapor concentration in the drum is less than 8600 ppm perc.

      (iv) The refrigerated condenser must be operated with a diverter valve.

      (v) Equivalent closed-loop vapor recovery systems or other control device must use a technology that has been demonstrated, pursuant to the requirements of 15 RCNY § 12-17, to achieve at least 90 percent by weight emission reduction based upon the amount of perc entering and leaving the control device.

   (6) A secondary control system must:

      (i) be designed to function with a primary control system complying with all requirements for third generation equipment.

      (ii) be capable of reducing the perc concentration in the drum from 8600 ppm or greater to 300 ppm.

      (iii) Any integral carbon adsorber used as a secondary control system must be sized correctly for the machine and be capable of reducing the perc concentration in the drum from 8,600 ppm or greater to 300 ppm or less.

      (iv) The integral carbon adsorber must be designed for non-contact steam or hot air stripping operation, and must be stripped or desorbed in accordance with manufacturer's instructions or at least weekly, whichever is more stringent.

   (7) Spill containment. All new third and fourth generation, or used, reinstalled dry cleaning equipment must be equipped with a spill containment system capable of containing 125 percent of the capacity of the largest dry cleaning perc tank or vessel associated with the dry cleaning machine.

(b) To determine which standards will apply to a particular dry cleaning facility, first determine whether the facility is new or existing. Then determine whether the facility is a stand-alone or is co-located. If co-located, determine whether it is in a commercial or residential building. Finally, for each piece of equipment there are two primary issues addressed by this Rule – the type of emissions control and the location of any process ventilation emission points.

**Subchapter B: Use of Best Available Technology and Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel Fuel**



*§ 14-02 Best Available Technology Determination.*


An engine that has been certified to meet the United States Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA") Tier IV Exhaust Emission Standards is deemed to be using the Best Available Technology ("BAT"), and does not require additional retrofit technologies. EPA's Tier IV Exhaust Emission Standards are described in Table 1 of the EPA`s Clean Air Nonroad Diesel Rule Fact Sheet, EPA420-F-04-032, May 2004, available at http://www.epa.gov/nonroaddiesel/2004fr/420f04032.htm. If an engine has not been certified to meet the Tier IV Exhaust Emission Standards, pursuant to § 24-163.3 of the Administrative Code, the BAT that must be utilized is one of the following, provided, that this technology shall achieve the greatest reduction in emissions of particulate matter and shall in no event result in an increase in the emissions of either particulate matter or nitrogen oxides:

Category I (a) Any properly installed and functioning system utilizing a Diesel Particulate Filter ("DPF") that primarily reduces emissions of particulate matter ("PM"), demonstrating an 85% or greater reduction in PM, and secondarily nitrogen oxide ("NOx") that appears on either the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") or the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") verified lists at http://www.epa.gov/otaq/retrofit/verif-list.htm and http://www.arb.ca.gov/diesel/verdev/background.htm for onroad or nonroad engines.

Category I (b) Any properly installed DPF from either the EPA or CARB verified lists.

Category I(c) A filter that has undergone the Verminderung der Emissionen Realer Dieselmotoren im Tunnelbau ("VERT") test procedure and appears as approved for continuous use on the VERT list maintained by http://akpf.org/pub/vert__filterliste.pdf or similar test procedures to those conducted by EPA/CARB and has demonstrated an 85% or greater reduction in emissions of PM.

Category II Any properly installed and functioning system utilizing a Flow through Filer ("FTF") that primarily reduces emissions of particulate matter ("PM") and secondarily nitrogen oxide ("NOx") that appears on either the verified lists for onroad or nonroad engines or any properly installed FTF on the verified list and that produces the greater PM reduction but not less than a 50% reduction in PM.

Category III Any properly installed and functioning system utilizing a Diesel Oxidation Catalyst ("DOC") or any emulsified diesel fuel that appears on either the EPA or CARB verified lists for onroad or nonroad engines that produces not less than a 25% reduction in FM. Fuel technologies must be compatible with the use of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel.






*§ 14-03 Method of Best Available Technology Selection.*


(a)  Any contractor or agency operating a type of nonroad vehicle must select the appropriate BAT for use with such type of nonroad vehicle. For each type of nonroad vehicle subject to the BAT requirement, the contractor or agency operating such type of vehicle must identify, in list form, all types of pollution control technology devices that qualify as BAT in Category I for such nonroad vehicle.

(b) All types of pollution control technology devices identified by the contractor or agency as Category I (a) BAT that are not technologically feasible for use with the subject type of nonroad vehicle are to be eliminated from the list of Category I (a) BAT. To eliminate a specific type of pollution control technology or individual device, the contractor or agency must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner and document that operational constraints or physical, chemical or engineering principles preclude the successful and effective use of the nonroad vehicle when used with the specific pollution control technologies of that type. The contractor or agency shall then consider DPFs that satisfy the requirements set forth in Category I(b). If use of a Category I(b) DPF is technologically feasible, the contractor or agency must notify the Commissioner of the selection and the installation schedule. If none are technologically feasible, the contractor or agency shall select the technology devices set forth in Category I(c).

(c) If, after the elimination process, no technologies remain in Category I (a), (b), or (c) from which the contractor or agency can select a BAT, the contractor or agency shall apply for Approval of a Written Finding of Unavailbility. Upon approval by the DEP, the same identification and elimination process shall be done for Category II. If, after the elimination process, no technologies remain in Category II from which the contractor or agency can select a BAT, the same identification and elimination process shall be done for Category III. If, after the elimination process, no technologies remain in Category III from which the contractor or agency can select a BAT, the contractor or agency operating the subject nonroad vehicle shall apply for an Approval of a Written Finding of Unavailability or a Safety Waiver.

(d) Once a category is selected as provided for in (c) above, an economic impact analysis is to be performed on the remaining technologies if the technology reduces both PM and NOx. If the cost of the technology that provides NOx control is equal to or greater than thirty percent more than that of the technology without NOx control, then the technology without NOx control shall be selected. For the purpose of this paragraph, the criteria that shall be considered is the cost of the strategies, themselves and the cost of installation.

(e) For newly purchased vehicles, BAT may be Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") installed control technology, provided that the technology is selected in a manner such that it provides the greatest reduction in particulate matter above the PM standard that the EPA has certified without increasing NOx and that reduction is verified by the manufacturer. The BAT need not be on EPA or CARB verified retrofit lists.

(f) The contractor or agency must use the pollution control technology identified as BAT by the process set forth in this subchapter.

(g) Prior to the installation of the selected technology, the contractor or agency shall notify the DEP of the BAT selection and contact the DEP when the DPF or other BAT is installed pursuant to this chapter and § 24-163.3 of the Administrative Code. The contractor or agency shall make arrangements to have the unit inspected and registered and the DEP shall label the vehicle as compliant. The contractor shall retain all documentation generated in the BAT selection process for as long as the selected BAT is in use. A contractor's failure to fully document the selection process or to provide such documentation shall be considered a violation of subdivision e of § 24-163.3 and is subject to applicable penalties.






*§ 14-04 Best Available Technology Selection Applicability.*


(a)  The BAT listed in this subchapter may be amended, superseded, or repealed at any time. However, no contractor or agency will be required to replace a selected BAT within three years of first using such BAT on any nonroad vehicle.

(b) A contractor or agency who is using a DPF that does not appear on the EPA or CARB verified lists may use such DPF for three years from the date it was first installed. After such three-year period, if such DPF does not appear on either the EPA or CARB verified lists, such DPF may not be used in nonroad vehicles used in City projects.

(c) A contractor or agency who is using Category I(c) technology may use such technology for three years from the date it was first installed. After such three-year period, if such technology does not appear on either the EPA or CARB verifid lists, such technology may not be used in nonroad vehicles used in City projects.

(d) A contractor or agency that has installed technology that appears on either the EPA and/or CARB verified lists at the time of installation, but which has been removed from the EPA and/or CARB verified lists during the thirty months following installation, may not use such technology in nonroad vehicles used in City projects at the conclusion of the three-year period following installation. A contractor or agency that has installed technology that appears on the EPA and/or CARB verified lists at the time of installation, but which has been removed from the EPA and/or CARB verified lists during the six months preceding the conclusion of the three-year period following installation, or at any time after the conclusion of such three-year period, may use such technology in nonroad vehicles for an additional six months following the date it was removed from the EPA and/or CARB verified lists.






*§ 14-05 Use of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel Fuel.*


All nonroad vehicles subject to this rule must be powered by ultra low sulfur diesel fuel, regardless of which BAT is selected, unless the Commissioner has issued a written determination pursuant to subdivision i of § 24-163.3 permitting the use of diesel fuel that has a sulfur content of no more than thirty parts per million.






*§ 14-06 Public Works Contracts.*


Any contractor acting pursuant to a public works contract that is subject to the provisions of paragraph four of subdivision f of § 24-163.3, but not paragraph one or three of such subdivision, shall comply with this subchapter and subchapters A and C of this chapter as of June 19, 2005.

**Subchapter B: Use of Best Available Retrofit Technology and Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel Fuel**



*§ 15-02 Best Available Retrofit Technology Determination.*


Pursuant to section 24-163.4 of the Code, any diesel fuel-powered motor vehicle having a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 8,500 pounds that is owned or operated by a City agency must utilize the Best Available Retrofit Technology ("BART"), as defined in 15 RCNY § 15-01. In making their selections, agencies are directed to consult the EPA and CARB verified lists at http://www.epa.gov/ otaq/retrofit/retroverifiedlist.htm and http://www.arb.ca.gov/diesel/verdev/back-ground.htm.

City agencies must select BART for their diesel fuel-powered motor vehicles in accordance with 15 RCNY § 15-05. City agencies must notify the Department of their selections, and the Department will make a determination as to whether the BART selected may be utilized for the vehicle, engine and application for which it was selected. The Department will notify the selecting agency of its determination. City agencies are not required to select BART for their diesel fuel-powered motor vehicles in the following circumstances:

(1) If a vehicle will be retired within the next 12 months, the vehicle does not have to be retrofitted if vehicle usage is limited to 2,000 miles; if the agency does not limit such usage to 2,000 miles, a DOC must be installed; and

(2) If a vehicle will be retired within the next 36 months, the vehicle must have a DOC installed, and vehicle usage must be limited to yearly mileage of 3,000 miles or 30% of the mileage averaged over the last three years, whichever is less. Agencies that are retiring their vehicles pursuant to this section must provide the odometer or hour-meter reading and date it was taken to the Department and must maintain a mileage log for the vehicle(s).






*§ 15-03 Motor Vehicles That Are Not Subject to BART.*


Any diesel fuel-powered motor vehicle having a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 8,500 pounds that is owned or operated by a City agency and that is equipped with an engine certified to the applicable 2007 United States Environmental Protection Agency standard for particulate matter as set forth in section 86.007-11 of title 40 of the code of federal regulations or to any subsequent United States environmental protection agency standard for such pollutant that is at least as stringent, shall not be required to utilize the BART as defined in 15 RCNY § 15-01.






*§ 15-04 Classification Levels.*


Level IV Any Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) or other technology verified for a specific application from either the CARB or EPA verified lists that reduces diesel particulate matter emissions by 85 percent or greater, or reduces engine emissions to less than or equal to 0.01 grams diesel particulate matter per brake horsepower-hour.

Level III Any DPF or Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) or Catalyzed Wire Mesh Filter (CWMF) or other technology or combination of technologies verified for a specific application from either the CARB or EPA verified lists that reduces diesel particulate matter emissions by between 50 and 84 percent.

Level II Any DOC or other technology verified for a specific application from either the CARB or EPA verified lists that reduces diesel particulate matter emissions by between 25 and 49 percent.

Level I Any DOC or emulsified diesel fuel or other technology verified for a specific application from either the CARB or EPA verified lists that reduces diesel particulate matter emissions by between 20 and 24 percent.






*§ 15-05 Selection Process.*


(a)  For each type of motor vehicle subject to the BART requirement, the City agency operating such vehicle must identify, in list form, all types of pollution control technology devices verified for such motor vehicle at classification Level IV.

(b) All types of pollution control technology devices identified by the City agency as classification Level IV devices that are not technologically feasible for use with respect to the particular vehicle, engine or application are to be eliminated from such list. To eliminate all types of pollution control technology devices identified by the agency at classification Level IV, or a specific type of pollution control technology, or a particular pollution control technology device, the agency must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that operational constraints or physical, chemical or engineering principles preclude the successful and effective use of the motor vehicle when used with such types of technology devices, or type of technology, or particular pollution control technology device.

(c) If, after the elimination process, no pollution control technology devices remain in classification Level IV from which the City agency can select a BART, the same identification and elimination process must be done for classification Level III. If after the elimination process, no pollution control technology devices remain in classification Level III from which the City agency can select a BART, the same identification and elimination process must be done for classification Level II. If after the elimination process, no pollution control technology devices remain in classification Level II from which the City agency can select a BART, the same identification and elimination process must be done for classification Level I.

(d) Once a level is selected as provided for in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) of this section, an economic impact analysis is to be performed on the remaining technologies where the technology reduces both PM and nitrogen oxide (NOx). The agency shall select the technology achieving, at a reasonable cost, the greatest reduction in NOx emissions.

(e) The Commissioner may determine, upon application by a City agency, that a technology, whether or not it has been verified by the United States environmental protection agency or the California air resources board, may be appropriate to test, on an experimental basis, on a particular type of diesel fuel-powered motor vehicle owned or operated by a City agency. The Commissioner may authorize such technology to be installed on up to five percent or twenty-five of such type of motor vehicle, whichever is less.






*§ 15-06 Best Available Retrofit Technology Selection Applicability.*


No City agency shall be required to replace a selected BART or an experimental technology within three years of having first utilized such technology. Furthermore, no City agency shall be required to replace Level IV technology until it has reached the end of its useful life.






*§ 15-07 Use of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel Fuel.*


All motor vehicles owned or operated by a City agency must be powered by ultra low sulfur diesel fuel unless the Commissioner has issued a written determination pursuant to subdivision (e) of section 24-163.4 of the Code, or a waiver pursuant to subdivision (f) of section 24-163.4 of the Code.

The Fishing Boat must be stored in the assigned Boat Storage Area when not in use on the water. A Fishing Boat not stored within its assigned Fishing Boat Storage Area will be subject to confiscation by NYCDEP.

NYCDEP may grant a Fishing Boat Tag holder a storage space in either a:

   (1) Closed Boat Storage Area: a Boat Storage Area designated by NYCDEP that requires protection to prevent damage to City Property such as erosion, soil compaction or loss of vegetation. The number of Fishing Boats stored in a Closed Boat Storage Area may not exceed the number of Fishing Boats NYCDEP reasonably determines as the limit for that area, in view of conditions in and around such area. Fishing Boat owners may request to be on a Waiting List, described below, to store his or her Fishing Boat in a Closed Boat Storage Area. Provided the Fishing Boat owner remains in good standing and has resolved any violation of these regulations to NYCDEP’s satisfaction, upon submission of a renewal for a Fishing Boat Tag that was previously assigned to a Closed Boat Area, NYCDEP will assign the same Fishing Boat to the Closed Storage Area it is located in provided the Fishing Boat has not been transferred to a new owner since the prior Fishing Boat Tag was issued by NYCDEP.

      (i) If a Fishing Boat Owner transfers ownership of a Fishing Boat that is stored in a Closed Boat Storage Area, the Boat Purchaser must remove the Fishing Boat from the Closed Boat Storage Area. The Boat Purchaser may submit a Fishing Boat Tag application to store the boat in an Open Boat Storage Area on the same Reservoir. If there is no Open Boat Storage Area on that Reservoir, the Boat Purchaser must remove the Fishing Boat from City Property. The Boat Purchaser may submit a Fishing Boat Tag application to place the Fishing Boat in an Open Boat Storage Area on another Reservoir and, in addition, may submit a Waiting List Application for a Reservoir with a Closed Boat Storage Area.

      (ii) Waiting List: NYCDEP will maintain and utilize a Waiting List for each Reservoir with a Closed Boat Storage Area in order to allocate Fishing Boat storage spaces in such areas. A person may request to be placed on a Reservoir’s Closed Boat Storage Area Waiting List by requesting a Waiting List application from NYCDEP or its designee, completing the Waiting List application, and returning it to NYCDEP either by mail or in person. NYCDEP will place the name on the Waiting List based upon the order in which the completed Waiting List application was received except that a Fishing Boat owner who has exceeded the boat limits established by NYCDEP pursuant to 15 RCNY § 16-10.3(7) will not be placed on a Waiting List.

   (2) Open Boat Storage Area: a Fishing Boat storage area designated by NYCDEP that has suitable storage space as determined by NYCDEP for a Fishing Boat with a Fishing Boat Tag without overcrowding or damaging City Property. NYCDEP will assign each applicant who receives a Fishing Boat Tag a storage space in an Open Boat Storage Area on the requested Reservoir, if available. If there is no Open Boat Storage Area on the requested Reservoir, the applicant may submit a Waiting List application as described in 15 RCNY § 16-10.1(v)(1)(i) and (ii) above.

A Fishing Boat owner may request a change of an assigned Boat Storage Area for their Fishing Boat on the same water body once per calendar year by contacting NYCDEP. NYCDEP will grant a change of an assigned Boat Storage Area provided that the requested Boat Storage Area is open to additional Fishing Boats.

(w) Fishing Boat Storage. When not in use on the water for Fishing, a Fishing Boat must be stored in its assigned Boat Storage Area at all times. From December 1st to April 1st, a Fishing Boat must be stored above the High Water Mark within its assigned Boat Storage Area. It is recommended that a Fishing Boat owner store their Fishing Boat back from the shoreline so as not to obstruct other anglers’ access to the water. DEP, at its sole discretion, may delineate by signage or on maps, shoreline buffer zones, which are within 10 feet of the High Water Mark of the shoreline. A shoreline buffer zone may be delineated on a new and/or an expanded Boat Storage Area or in an existing Boat Storage Area that is considered to have soil compaction, vegetation loss, or erosion. Fishing Boats found within a NYCDEP-delineated shoreline buffer zone are subject to removal by NYCDEP.

Where manufactured hitching posts, stanchions or boat racks are supplied and have available space, a Fishing Boat must be secured to them. A Fishing Boat must not be stored on or against other stored Fishing Boats, as this may make some Fishing Boats inaccessible to their owners.

A Fishing Boat must not be stored leaning against a tree unless there is no space available on a hitching post or other securing mechanism as provided by NYCDEP. Storage against a tree must be in a manner that does not damage the tree or may result in the boat being blown over into a hull-down position. A Fishing Boat must not be secured to a dead tree or a tree marked with blue paint by NYCDEP.

Improper stored boats may be subject to removal by NYCDEP or Access Permits holders may be subject to the penalties in 15 RCNY § 16-15.

(x) Fishing Boat Placement and Securing. To prevent the creation of insect breeding grounds in water-filled Fishing Boats, each Fishing Boat must, except as provided in this subdivision, be stored hull-up (upside down) and flat against the ground at all times.

A Fishing Boat owner may store on site such fishing equipment as may be secured under their overturned, stored Fishing Boat. Equipment or items left on City Property and not secured under a Fishing Boat is subject to NYCDEP confiscation and disposal. A Fishing Boat owner is encouraged to secure their stored Fishing Boat to reduce the possibility of theft and scattering. Improper stored boats may be subject to removal by NYCDEP or Access Permits holders may be subject to the penalties in 15 RCNY § 16-15.

(y) Owner Removal of a Fishing Boat. Fishing Boat owners may remove their Fishing Boats from City Property at any time. Fishing Boat owners must notify the appropriate NYCDEP Boat Office before removing their Fishing Boat from City Property. Upon removal of a Fishing Boat from City Property, its Fishing Boat Tag is immediately rendered invalid and the boat can no longer be stored or used on City Property. Fishing Boat owners wishing to return a once-registered, removed Fishing Boat to a City Reservoir or Controlled Lake must make a registration and processing appointment with the appropriate NYCDEP Boat Office, or designee, as listed on the NYCDEP website.

(z) Change of Reservoir or Controlled Lake. Fishing Boat owners with a valid Access Permit may change the location of their Fishing Boat from one Reservoir or Controlled Lake to another Reservoir or Controlled Lake provided there is an Open Boat Storage Area. Such change will be treated the way a new boat would be treated. This will require an application, boat processing appointment, and a new Fishing Boat Tag.

By accepting a Fishing or Recreational Boat Tag, the owner of the tagged boat acknowledges and accepts NYCDEP’s and its designee’s right to confiscate and store a boat that NYCDEP determines is in violation of these regulations; NYCDEP’s right to dispose of the boat in accordance with this section; and waives any right to assert a claim against NYCDEP and/or its designee for such confiscation and/or disposal or hold either liable under any circumstances for damage to, or loss of, a boat or accessories such as, but not limited to, chains, locks and oars during its confiscation, storage or disposition.

When a boat is confiscated by NYCDEP or its designee, a record of the boat’s condition will be prepared and maintained including the following information: a boat description, date of confiscation, storage location, condition, equipment with the boat, if any, estimated value, and whether it appears seaworthy or not. Such record will be maintained until NYCDEP or its designee disposes of said boat in accordance with these Rules.

When a boat is confiscated, a one-time confiscation penalty of $120.00 will be assessed per boat. A storage fee of $1.00 per day will also be assessed per boat until the boat is claimed by its owner, or until the storage fee adds up to $90. Together the confiscation penalty and storage fees will not exceed $210.00 in total per boat.

NYCDEP or its designee will send a written notice to attempt to contact the owner of a NYCDEP confiscated boat within 30 days from the date NYCDEP deems the boat confiscated in order to notify such owner of the boat’s status. This written notice will be documented by NYCDEP or its designee and may be by USPS mail, or electronic mail using the contact information on file for the Access Permit/Boat Tag holder. If a confiscated boat has no record of ownership with NYCDEP, the boat will be held for 3 months and if unclaimed, disposed of in accordance with 15 RCNY § 16-10.3(4).

(2) Storage of NYCDEP-Confiscated Boats. NYCDEP or its designee will secure a confiscated boat on NYCDEP or its designee’s property until the confiscated boat is claimed by its owner or until 3 months have passed from the date of notice of confiscation by NYCDEP or its designee. Storage may include a boat being left in place and secured on City Property until it can be disposed of by NYCDEP or its designee.

(3) Owner Claim of Confiscated Boats. All boats confiscated and stored by NYCDEP or its designee will be available for claim and pick up within the 3 month storage period by the boat owner of record, by appointment with NYCDEP or its designee. NYCDEP or its designee’s staff will confirm that the person claiming the boat is the boat owner of record. Any accumulated confiscation penalty and storage fees must be paid to the order of NYCDEP by certified check, bank check, or money order and must be tendered to NYCDEP or its designee in order for the boat to be released. An owner must pay any accumulated penalties and fees and remove their claimed boat at the same appointment; NYCDEP or its designees will not hold claimed boats or allow deferred payment. NYCDEP, or its designee after consulting with NYCDEP, may in extreme circumstances (such as death or a debilitating illness of a boat owner), waive any accumulated penalties and/or fees.

(4) Disposal of confiscated property. When necessary, NYCDEP will dispose of boats and other property confiscated by NYCDEP through any of the following means:

   (i) Sale by the New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services; or

   (iii) The relinquishment letter must be mailed to NYCDEP at 71 Smith Avenue Kingston, NY 12401 or its designee, if applicable.

(6) Lost and Stolen Property. Property owners must report all property believed to be lost or stolen to the appropriate NYCDEP Boat Office and the NYCDEP Police upon discovery. A boat owner whose boat has been stolen and has filed a report with NYCDEP Police may replace the boat at the same Boat Storage Area within 90 days of the Police report filing date. This will be allowed even if the Boat Storage Area is closed.

(7) Limitations. To limit potential adverse water quality or natural resource impacts, overcrowding, and for other such other reasons as NYCDEP may deem necessary or appropriate, NYCDEP may:

   (i) Limit the number of valid Fishing or Recreational Boat Tags any individual can hold at one time;

   (ii) Limit the number of Reservoir-specific valid Fishing or Recreational Boat Tags any individual can hold at one time;

(f) Appeals. Individuals may appeal the suspension or revocation of their Access Permit privileges and/or ability to apply for public access privileges by submitting to the Deputy Chief of City Land Stewardship, within 30 days of the date of the NYCDEP letter of suspension or revocation, a written request explaining why the penalty should be changed. In support of an appeal, an individual must submit:

   (1) an explanation as to why the penalty imposed is not justified by the circumstances presented;

   (2) a statement indicating his or her commitment to abide by all Rules, policies, and conditions in the future.

The Deputy Chief of City Land Stewardship will respond to all appeals in writing within 45 days of receipt. In response to a written appeal, NYCDEP may reduce the duration of suspension or revocation period. Factors NYCDEP will consider in determining whether to grant or deny an appeal request include whether the individual has committed any other Rule infractions within the previous 5 years and whether the infraction at issue threatened or compromised Water Supply quality or security, public safety or led to property damage or injury to any individual. Court dispositions of any summons issued or arrests made for reasons other than a violation of these rules will not negate any such violations, but may be considered during an appeal review by NYCDEP. Individuals dissatisfied with the first appeal response may elect to submit a final written appeal to the Deputy Commissioner for the NYCDEP Bureau of Water Supply for a final determination.

(g) Reinstatement. Upon conclusion of the suspension period for a suspended Access Permit and/or Tags, NYCDEP will send notification of reinstatement via USPS or electronic mail to the Access Permit holder at the address on file. This notification will include the return of any confiscated Access Permit or Tag that is still valid or an application for a replacement.

(h) Group Infractions. Any violation of these Rules and/or the Group Access Permit conditions by a Group Member may result in:

   (1) Expulsion of the Group and/or Group Member from the property;

   (2) Revocation of the Group Access Permit;

   (3) Loss of general privileges to access City Property including loss of eligibility to apply for an Access Permit, suspension or revocation of Access Permits; and

   (4) Arrest and prosecution of the Group Members, Group Leader, and/or organization sponsoring the Group and/or which the Group represents.

(i) Public Access Area and Day Use Area Infractions. Failure to comply with these Rules, postings or notices in a Public Access Area or a Day Use Area may result in, but not be limited to, one or more of the following:

   (1) Expulsion from City Property;

   (2) Suspension or revocation of Access Permit and/or Tag privileges, if applicable

   (3) Prohibition from obtaining an Access Permit or Tag;

   (4) Suspension from access to some, any or all City Property;

The following rules apply to any permitted occupation or use of New York City property (lands, water bodies, reservoirs and infrastructure) in the counties of Delaware, Dutchess, Greene, Orange, Putnam, Schoharie, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester. These rules are for the benefit of municipalities, utilities, government agencies, organizations exempt from federal taxation pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3), individuals and commercial enterprises who may want to access or to occupy City owned property. The New York City Department of Environmental Protection is the City agency designated as the issuing authority for Revocable Land Use Permits ("Permits").






*§ 17-02 Definitions.*

(b) Commissioner. "Commissioner" means the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection or a Deputy Commissioner authorized to act for such Department pursuant to law.

(c) Low-Impact Uses. "Low-impact uses" mean those uses with little or no soil, vegetation, stream, or wetland disturbances and no siting of impervious surfaces or structures. The term "low-impact uses" does not include any alterations that would increase the rate or volume of stormwater runoff.

(d) Property Value. "Property Value" means the assessed value (land only) of property adjacent to or similar to the City property subject to a Permit, in proportion to the acreage of City property subject to a Permit, adjusted by the New York State equalization rate.

*§ 17-03 Applications and Application Fees.*

Prior to submission of the application, applicants must discuss their Permit request at the telephone number above with a staff member of the Land Use Permit Office or any other authorized DEP employee. Applications may then be hand-delivered to an authorized DEP employee or submitted by United States Postal Service (USPS) mail to: NYC Department of Environmental Protection Land Use Permit Office 465 Columbus Avenue Valhalla, NY 10595

Notification of the availability of internet application submission will be posted on the DEP website.

(b) All applications for Permits must be accompanied by a non-refundable application fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) payable to the order of "The City of New York" by money order or check unless such fee is waived pursuant to 15 RCNY § 17-07(c). Notification of the availability of payment by credit card will be posted on the DEP website.

(c) Applications must contain all materials related to the Permit request, including but not limited to detailed plans, sketches, maps and surveys that show the areas of the proposed uses and adjacent City property boundaries.

*§ 17-04 Term and Renewal.*


(a) The issuance and renewal terms of the permits shall not exceed five (5) years. Permits may be renewed for additional five (5) year terms upon DEP's approval of an updated application for renewal, and any additional plans, engineering drawings or documents required by DEP. DEP will send Permit renewal applications to permittees.

(b) If a Permit is not renewed, use of City property must cease at the conclusion of the term of the Permit. The property must be restored to DEP's satisfaction within thirty (30) days of the date of the expiration of the Permit. DEP will determine, based on the nature and location of the area requiring restoration, whether DEP or the former permittee will perform such restoration. The former permittee is responsible for all restoration costs regardless whether the permittee or DEP performs such restoration. If DEP allows the permittee to undertake the restoration, the former permittee must secure a permit prior to beginning the restoration work. Failure to complete such restoration to the satisfaction of DEP may result in the exercise of any legal remedies available to DEP.






*§ 17-05 Conditions.*


All Permits will include standard conditions and may also include special conditions specific to the use of the City property, as deemed necessary. The permittee must sign an acknowledgment before a Notary Public accepting all conditions including Permit fees set forth by DEP as a requirement of Permit issuance.

*§ 17-13 Repeal.*


These rules are intended to repeal those rules entitled Issuance of Temporary Permits for the Occupation of City Property, effective September 2, 2001; provided, however, that with respect to Permits issued before the effective date of these rules, all restrictions, conditions and requirements upon the permittee contained in the earlier rules shall remain in effect until such Permit is renewed, cancelled, terminated or revoked.




Chapter 18: Protection from Contamination, Degradation and Pollution of the New York City Water Supply and Its Sources
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




**Subchapter A: General Provisions**



*§ 18-11 Preface.*


(a)  The health, welfare and economic well-being of nearly nine million residents in the five counties of New York City ("the City"), and of an increasing number of upstate New York communities is inextricably tied to the quality of the source waters in the watersheds of the New York City Water Supply located in Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Delaware, Ulster, Greene, Sullivan and Schoharie Counties, and Fairfield County in Connecticut. The high quality of these waters faces a continuing threat from the cumulative and episodic impacts of pollution sources generated by certain land uses and activities in the watersheds. It is the duty of the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (the "Department") to protect the high quality of waters from which the City's water supply is drawn and preserve it from degradation for the purpose of protecting the health and general welfare of its consumers.

(b) These rules and regulations repeal in their entirety and supersede the Rules and Regulations for the Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity of the City of New York enacted the 11th day of June, 1953.

(c) These rules and regulations are hereby enacted pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, as set forth in 15 RCNY § 18-13.






*§ 18-12 Purpose and Findings.*


(a)  The quality of the drinking water supplied to the City and upstate communities which draw from the New York City water supply depends primarily on the quality of the source waters which feed the reservoirs. The source waters and reservoirs are vulnerable to degradation and contamination from various sources and activities, including, but not limited to:

   (1) Wastewater discharges to surface water and groundwater;

   (2) Urban, suburban, rural, mining, silvicultural and agricultural land use practices that result in nonpoint source runoff of pollution and/or in adverse changes in the natural rate at which water flows into and through a delineated drainage basin; and

   (3) Improper use, handling, storage, transport and/or disposal of substances, including but not limited to, hazardous substances, radioactive materials, pesticides, fertilizers, winter highway maintenance materials, solid wastes, and animal wastes.

(b) The Department finds that such sources and activities, either alone or in conjunction with any other related activities, may constitute a source of contamination to or degradation of the water supply, may cause a contravention of the State water quality standards set forth in 6 NYCRR Parts 701-705, and Subchapter D of these rules and regulations, and may result in the impairment of the use of the water supply for drinking, culinary or food processing purposes.

(c) In response to the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1986, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has begun implementing a significant expansion of regulatory requirements for public water systems. In order to protect the public health, and to satisfy the legislative mandates of the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments and the rules and regulations in 40 C.F.R. Parts 141 and 142, the New York State Department of Health has amended the State Sanitary Code, 10 NYCRR Part 5, Subpart 5-1, Public Water Systems, which contains New York State's Surface Water Treatment Rule. Although both Federal and State law propose filtration as a method for water quality treatment for pathogen control, the effectiveness of the filtration process and complexity of plant operation is dependent upon the quality of the water entering the filtration plant. In addition, many contaminants are not removed by conventional filtration. Therefore, it is clear that enhancement of the City's existing watershed rules and regulations would be necessary even if the City were to build filtration plants to filter its entire water supply.

(d) It is the goal and intent of these rules and regulations to protect the public health by averting future contamination to and degradation of the water supply and by remediating existing sources of pollution or degradation of the New York City water supply. These rules and regulations implement the Department's intention to minimize the discharge of pollutants into the source waters from both point and nonpoint sources, minimize the adverse impacts of erosion, limit the discharge of phosphorus to source waters which may accelerate the eutrophication process, and provide notification to the City of ongoing or proposed activities, which either alone or in conjunction with other existing and proposed regulated activities, may cause contamination to or degradation of the water supply.

(e) It is the purpose of these rules and regulations to insure compliance with the Federal and State standards by providing a comprehensive watershed protection program. Furthermore, these rules and regulations articulate an antidegradation policy for the New York City water supply system. These rules and regulations are promulgated to govern those activities in the watershed that threaten the quality of the water supply of the numerous upstate communities and the City of New York. While bound by its responsibility to protect the public health, the City has also taken the needs of the communities and businesses in the New York City watershed into consideration in drafting and promulgating these rules and regulations.

(f) The City reserves the right to re-examine these rules and regulations periodically to insure that they continue to further the goal and intent referred to in paragraph (d) of this subdivision and the purposes referred to in paragraph (e) of this subdivision.








*§ 18-13 Authority.*

Failure by the applicant to submit information to the Department or to follow the Department procedures set forth in these rules and regulations is sufficient grounds to deny the approval.

   (3) Any person seeking approval of an activity may be subject to such terms and conditions as the Department may require, including time limitations and limitations on transfer of the approval given by the Department.

   (4) (i)  An applicant shall affirmatively state in the application whether any enforcement action has been commenced during the five (5) years preceding the application against the applicant, or any principal or affiliate of the applicant, for alleged violations of law related to the specific regulated activity for which the approval is sought, or related to the facility or site at which the activity is located. The applicant shall supply the following information with respect to each enforcement action: the agency or entity commencing the action, the date of commencement, the facility location and address where the alleged violation occurred, and disposition of the action.

      (ii) Failure to fully and accurately disclose any material information required to be disclosed pursuant to subparagraph 4(i) shall be a basis for the Department to deny a permit application.

      (iii) Failure to cure any adjudicated violation of this Chapter or any law, rule or regulation enforced by the Department shall be a basis to deny a permit application.

      (iv) If the Department or the City has commenced an enforcement action against the applicant for violations of law related to the facility or site at which the activity for which the approval is sought is located, the Department may suspend processing of the application until such alleged violations are cured.

   (5) Any property owner may request that the Department perform a site visit and evaluation to determine and flag the presence of a watercourse, reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake on the owner's property. If the property owner supplies the Department with a surveyor's map of the property which includes a representation of the flagged watercourses, reservoirs, reservoir stems or controlled lakes identified by the Department, the Department shall confirm or annotate the findings upon the surveyor's map as soon as is practicable. A confirmed survey map shall be binding upon the Department for five years following the date of the confirmation.

   (6) If an applicant for Department review and approval of a regulated activity requests that the Department conduct a site visit and evaluation to determine and flag the presence of a watercourse, reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake on the applicant's property the Department shall do so as soon as is practicable. If the applicant supplies the Department with a surveyor's map of the property which includes a representation of the flagged watercourses, reservoirs, reservoir stems or controlled lakes identified by the Department, the Department shall confirm or annotate the findings upon the surveyor's map within 20 business days of receipt thereof. A confirmed survey map shall be binding upon the Department for five years following the date of the confirmation. The absence of a Department confirmed surveyor's map will not cause an application to be considered incomplete.

(c) An application shall contain the following information:

   (1) An application for the review and approval of any activity listed in 15 RCNY § 18-14 shall provide a description of the activity, the location and topography of the area of the activity, identification of any existing structures at the location, and any engineering, construction or other plans which detail the methods to be used in undertaking the activity such that it shall meet the requirements of this Subchapter and any additional requirements for the specific activity set forth in these rules and regulations.

   (2) An application for review and approval of any activity listed in 15 RCNY § 18-14 shall include a copy of any Environmental Assessment Form (EAF), and either a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) or a determination of nonsignificance by the lead agency, where such documents are prepared pursuant to Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

   (3) When a regulated activity requires a related approval from any other agency or more than one approval from the Department, the application for review and approval shall include a list of such approvals which the applicant knows to be required, and a statement of the status of any required approval at the time of filing of the application with the Department.

   (4) An application for review and approval of any regulated activity shall include the name, address, telephone number, email address, and fax number of the applicant or the applicant's authorized representative, and of the design professional(s), if any, involved in preparing the application.

(d) Review and Approval Procedures.

The Department shall notify the applicant in writing within ten (10) days of receiving the additional information that has been requested either that the application is complete and that the Department has commenced its review or that further information is required.

      (iii) Except in cases where the applicant has submitted false or misleading information or where a change in relevant law has occurred or changes have been proposed for the project, the Department may require further information based only upon the additional information submitted by the applicant or new issues raised by such information. In addition, the Department may also require further information based on a change in ownership of the property, the identity of the applicant, or the identity of the applicant's owners, principals, shareholders, directors, or officers.

   (3) If the Department fails to notify an applicant in writing of its determination as to the completeness or incompleteness of the application within the time periods set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this subdivision, the applicant may notify the Department of its failure by means of certified mail, return receipt requested, to the local Department representative identified in 15 RCNY § 18-15 who is responsible for processing the application and a copy to the Engineering Section. If the Department fails to notify the applicant of its determination as to the completeness or incompleteness of the application within ten (10) business days of receiving the notice, the application shall be deemed complete as of the eleventh day.

   (4) The Department shall notify the applicant in writing of its determination within twenty (20) days of determining that an application for review and approval of a conventional individual sewage treatment system to be installed on an individual lot which is not within a subdivision is complete pursuant to the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this subdivision unless the Department and the applicant mutually agree in writing upon an extension of the twenty (20) day review period.

If, during the forty-five (45) day review period, the Department requests revisions to the application, the review period shall be suspended from the date such request is made until the date on which the Department receives such revisions, provided that the Department shall have no fewer than ten (10) days from the date of receipt to issue a determination.

   (6) If the Department fails to notify an applicant in writing of its determination within the twenty (20) day time period as set forth in paragraph (d)(4) of this subdivision or the forty-five (45) day time period as set forth in paragraph (d)(5) of this subdivision, the applicant may notify the Department of its failure by means of certified mail, return receipt requested to the local Department representative identified in 15 RCNY § 18-15 who is responsible for processing the application and a copy to Regulatory and Engineering Programs. The notice shall contain the applicant's name, location of the proposed project, the office in which the application was filed, and a statement that a decision is sought in accordance with this subdivision. Any notice failing to provide this information will not invoke this provision.

      (i) If the Department fails to notify the applicant of its decision within ten (10) business days of the receipt of such notice, the application shall be deemed approved subject to the standard terms and conditions applicable to such an approval.

   (7) Notwithstanding the time period for notifying an applicant of the Department's determination specified in paragraphs (d)(4), (d)(5) and (d)(6) of this section, if a lead agency has determined that a project may have a significant effect on the environment for purposes of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), such time periods shall be suspended pending receipt from the lead agency of either a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) or a determination of nonsignificance. Upon receipt of either document, the time periods shall resume, provided, however, that the Department shall have at least twenty (20) days to notify an applicant of its determination.

   (8) Notwithstanding the time periods for decisions specified in this subdivision, the Department may condition an approval on the applicant providing satisfactory proof of any bonds required by the Department within thirty days of the applicant receiving the conditional approval from the Department.

   (9) Any notice required or permitted to be given by the Department under this Subchapter shall be given in such manner designed to reach the applicant, as the Department deems appropriate, and may include, but is not limited to, regular mail, certified mail return receipt requested, or telecopier.








*§ 18-24 Emergency Procedures.*


(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Subchapter, where an expedited review and approval of a regulated activity is necessary to respond to an imminent threat to the health and safety of humans or animals, or to respond to a substantial imminent threat to property, an applicant seeking such review and approval shall notify the Department by telephone at the office of the local representative listed in 15 RCNY § 18-15, and shall meet with the Department within 24 hours.

(g) Where the Department proposes to modify, suspend, or revoke an approval or variance, and the person named in the approval or variance requests a hearing on the proposed modification, suspension, or revocation, the original conditions of the approval or variance shall remain in effect until a decision has been issued by the Commissioner pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section. At such time the modified conditions shall take effect.

(h) Nothing in this section shall preclude or affect the Department's authority to use the remedy of summary abatement or to issue a cease and desist order under these rules and regulations, or any other law or regulation or to seek injunctive relief to enforce these rules and regulations, or any other law or regulation, in a court of competent jurisdiction.








*§ 18-27 Noncomplying Regulated Activities.*

   (1) A noncomplying regulated activity may be continued except where specifically prohibited from continuing by these rules and regulations.

   (2) A noncomplying regulated activity shall come into compliance with these rules and regulations where specifically required to do so by these rules and regulations.

   (3) Should any noncomplying regulated activity cause contamination to or degradation of the water supply, such that the activity is a threat to the life, health, or safety of water supply users, the Commissioner may order that such noncomplying regulated activity conform either in whole or in part to the requirements of these rules and regulations, immediately or within a limited period of time at the Commissioner's discretion, or be discontinued immediately. Any person who receives such an order may request a hearing on such order in the manner provided in 15 RCNY § 18-29.

   (4) Any owner or operator of a noncomplying regulated activity who was not required by these rules and regulations to notify the Department pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, may request, in writing, a determination from the Department that such property or activity is a noncomplying regulated activity. The written request shall include a description of the property or activity and its location, and the name, telephone number, and email address of a contact person. The Department shall determine, based upon the submission, whether the property or activity is a noncomplying regulated activity, and shall notify the owner or operator of such determination in writing.

(b) Subsurface Sewage Treatment Systems. The regulations applicable to discontinuation, and the standards for alteration or modification, of noncomplying regulated activities that are subsurface sewage treatment systems are set forth in 15 RCNY § 18-38(b).

   (1) No noncomplying regulated activity involving storage of hazardous substances, storage of petroleum products, or the siting of junkyards and solid waste management facilities shall be substantially altered or modified without the prior review and approval of the Department. The Department shall review and approve such an alteration or modification in accordance with the standards and procedures set forth in Subchapter F (variances).

      (i) Such a noncomplying regulated activity may be reduced in size or extent, or replaced with a regulated activity that complies with the provisions of these rules and regulations, without such review and approval provided that such reduction does not cause any increase in any existing discharge or any increase in the potential for contamination to or degradation of the water supply.

   (2) In the case of storage of hazardous substances, storage of petroleum products, and the siting of junkyards and solid waste management facilities, a noncomplying regulated activity must come into compliance with these rules and regulations if, for any reason, there is discontinuation for a period of two consecutive years. If it cannot come into compliance, it must permanently desist. A period of discontinuation shall commence on the date when regular or seasonal use ceases. Incidental or illegal use of an unoccupied structure shall not be sufficient to interrupt a period of discontinuation, and intent to resume a noncomplying regulated activity shall not confer the right to do so. The burden of proof for showing that a noncomplying regulated activity has not been substantially discontinued shall be on the owner or operator.

*§ 18-38 Subsurface Sewage Treatment Systems.*


(a) Minimum Requirements for new subsurface sewage treatment systems.

   (1) The design, treatment, construction, maintenance and operation of new subsurface sewage treatment systems, and the plans therefor, require the review and approval of the Department, provided that the requirements of this section shall not apply to subsurface sewage treatment systems necessary for an agricultural activity that are designed, provide treatment and are constructed, maintained and operated in compliance with State and Federal law.

   (2) All new individual sewage treatment systems shall comply with the requirements of 10 NYCRR Part 75 and Appendix 75-A except where a local government or agency has enacted, or these rules and regulations specify, more stringent standards, in which case, the more stringent standards shall apply.

   (3) All new intermediate sized sewage treatment systems shall comply with the requirements set forth in New York State Design Standards for Intermediate Sized Wastewater Treatment Systems, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (2014), except where a local government or agency has enacted, or these rules and regulations specify, more stringent standards, in which case, the more stringent standards shall apply.

      (i) As a condition of approval the Department may require evidence of financial security prior to construction, from any owner or operator of a new intermediate sized sewage treatment system or a substantial alteration or modification to an existing intermediate sized sewage treatment system. Such financial security shall consist of a bond, or an equivalent guaranty, to be deposited with the Department, covering the full cost of the construction of such facility and an additional bond or an equivalent guaranty for the payment of labor and material furnished in the course of such construction. Upon completion of construction and payment of labor and materials, such bonds or other guaranties shall be released. Additionally, a bond or equivalent guaranty may be required for the maintenance and operation of the facility for a period of five years post-construction. No bond or guaranty is required where the owner or operator of such a facility is a village, town, county or city.

   (4) No part of any absorption field for any new subsurface sewage treatment system shall be located within the limiting distance of 100 feet of a watercourse or wetland or 300 feet of a reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake. For a new conventional individual subsurface sewage treatment system or for a new Ulster County Fill System the Department may recommend a greater limiting distance from an absorption field to a watercourse, wetland, reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake.

   (5) Raised systems, as described in 10 NYCRR Part 75 and Appendix 75-A, are allowed on undeveloped lots not located in a subdivision or on undeveloped residential lots located in a subdivision which was approved prior to the effective date of these rules and regulations, where site conditions are not suitable for a conventional system provided that:

      (i) The system shall be located at least 250 feet from any watercourse or wetland and 500 feet from any reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake provided that the greater limiting distance for raised systems does not preclude construction on the subject lot or lots of the use proposed by the applicant, and further provided that the site conditions and the subsurface sewage treatment system comply with the other provisions of these rules and regulations and other applicable Federal, State and local laws, as cited in 15 RCNY § 18-38(a)(1); or

      (ii) Raised systems which cannot meet the limiting distances set forth in subparagraph (i) due to size or location of the lot shall be located at the greatest limiting distance possible within the property lines and at least 100 feet from any watercourse or wetland and 300 feet from any reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake.

   (6) Where a watershed county has adopted a subdivision code that allows a raised system, as described in 10 NYCRR Part 75 and Appendix 75-A, or where the New York State Department of Health approved such raised systems for use in subdivisions located in the watershed, such raised systems are allowed in subdivisions that are approved subsequent to the effective date of these rules and regulations, provided that no part of such systems shall be located within 250 feet of a watercourse or wetland or 500 feet of a reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake.

   (7) Any approval of a subsurface sewage treatment system issued by the Department expires and is null and void unless construction is substantially completed such that the system is functioning as designed within five (5) years of the date of issuance for systems located within approved subdivisions, or within two (2) years of the date of issuance for all other subsurface sewage treatment systems. Following expiration of the approval, the plans for the subsurface sewage treatment system may be resubmitted to the Department for consideration for a new approval.

(b) Minimum requirements for alteration and modification, repair and remediation, and discontinuation of subsurface sewage treatment systems.

   (1) All subsurface sewage treatment systems, which are operating in accordance with their Federal, State, and local approvals, but which do not comply with the requirements for new subsurface sewage treatment systems set forth in this section, shall be allowed to continue to operate.

   (2) If the use of a subsurface sewage treatment system is, for any reason, subject to discontinuation for a period of five consecutive years or more, operation may resume if it comes into compliance with the standards for alterations or modifications of subsurface sewage treatment systems in accordance with 15 RCNY § 18-38(b)(4) below. If, however, the system cannot come into compliance with these standards, the use must permanently desist. The owner or operator bears the burden of proof for showing that there has been no discontinuation in the use of a subsurface sewage treatment system.

   (3) Any proposed alteration or modification of any subsurface sewage treatment system requires the review and approval of the Department, except as provided in subparagraphs (i) through (iii) below.

      (i) The volume, character, or strength of the flow to a subsurface sewage treatment system may be reduced without review and approval provided that such reduction does not cause any increase in the existing discharge or any increase in the potential for contamination to or degradation of the water supply from that discharge. If the reduction in the volume, character, or strength results from an alteration or modification of a system component, or the addition of a new system component (such as installation of a peat filter or aerobic treatment unit), then such alteration, modification, or addition requires review and approval of the Department, except that:

         a. Any such review and approval shall be limited to the affected system component; and

         b. No such review and approval is required where the alteration, modification, or addition of the system component is otherwise exempt from review under this section (such as the replacement of a septic tank with a larger tank of an appropriate size for the subsurface sewage treatment system).

      (ii) Except as set forth in this subdivision, for an intermediate sized subsurface sewage treatment system that has a State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) permit, review and approval is not required for any proposed alteration or modification that does not deviate from the engineering design and site plan approved by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.

         a. Review and approval by the Department is required if the alteration or modification requires a modification of the SPDES permit for the SSTS for any reason including, but not limited to:

            i. the alteration or modification involves physical alteration or modification of the SSTS, or

            ii. the alteration or modification results in the system receiving sewage that either exceeds the treatment system design flow, or has a strength or characteristic beyond the design capability of the treatment system.

         b. If the Department has previously issued an approval for an intermediate sized subsurface sewage treatment system, review and approval by the Department is required for any alteration or modification that results in the system receiving sewage that either exceeds the design flow of the system as approved by the Department, or has a strength or characteristic beyond the design capability of the system as approved by the Department.

      (iii) In the following circumstances, where an ancillary, non-residential use of a residence served by an individual subsurface sewage treatment system does not result in an increase in or change in the nature of the flow of sewage, the subsurface sewage treatment system shall not be considered an intermediate-sized sewage treatment system, nor shall such use require review and approval by the Department:

         a. Where the residence is used to provide accommodations for transient lodgers and no food service is provided other than to overnight guests, unless such use requires a temporary residence permit pursuant to 10 NYCRR Subpart 7-1.

         b. Where the individual residence is used for a home office or home business, provided that:

            i. The individual who operates the home office or home business occupies the home as his or her primary or secondary residence;

            ii. The home office or home business is of a type that is estimated to generate 50 gallons per day of water or less based on Table B-3 of the New York State Design Standards for Intermediate Sized Wastewater Treatment Systems, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (2014); and

            iii. The conversion does not involve an increase in the individual residence's number of bedrooms.

      (iii) Standard of review. The department will authorize use of a subsurface sewage treatment system that has been subject to a period of discontinuation for five consecutive years or more, or a proposed alteration or modification of a subsurface sewage treatment system, if the applicant demonstrates that such use, alteration, or modification does not present a threat to public health or water quality as determined by the Department.

   (5) If a subsurface sewage treatment system fails or needs remediation, the owner or operator of the subsurface sewage treatment system must comply with the following:

      (i) Any proposed remediation of any part of a subsurface sewage treatment system shall require the prior review and approval of the Department, and if approved, shall be completed as soon as possible in accordance with a schedule approved by the Department;

      (ii) Any proposed remediation of any part of a subsurface sewage treatment system shall be implemented, to the extent possible, in accordance with the design standards set forth in this section, and shall require the prior review and approval of the Department. However, if the Department determines, based upon the application submitted by the owner or operator of the subsurface sewage treatment system, that such system cannot comply with this section, the owner or operator of the subsurface sewage treatment system shall cooperate with the Department to determine the most suitable location and design for the system on the specific site. The Department may require the owner to agree to a regular schedule for the pump out of the septic tank or other remedial action, including the use of holding tanks, before the proposed remediation is approved by the Department and implemented; and

      (iii) The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to the routine repair and maintenance of a subsurface sewage treatment system, including, but not limited to, the pump out of a septic tank, the replacement of a septic tank, whether in kind or with a larger tank of an appropriate size for the subsurface sewage treatment system, the repair of a broken lateral, the leveling of a distribution box, or the removal of a blockage.

   (6) Any approval issued by the Department to use a subsurface sewage treatment system following a discontinuation expires and is null and void unless any required enhancements are implemented and such use is commenced within one (1) year of the date of issuance or such longer period as the Department may authorize in writing. Following expiration of the approval, the plans for the subsurface sewage treatment system may be resubmitted to the Department for consideration for a new approval.

   (7) Any approval of an alteration or modification of a subsurface sewage treatment system issued by the Department expires and is null and void unless any required enhancements are implemented within two (2) years of the date of issuance. Following expiration of the approval, the plans for the subsurface sewage treatment system may be resubmitted to the Department for consideration for a new approval.

   (8) Any property owner may request that the Department review and approve a proposed use of a subsurface sewage treatment system by demonstrating that it is capable of treating a specified volume and type of wastewater flow. The proposal may include proposed enhancements to the system. A determination by the Department that the subsurface sewage treatment system complies with the standards applicable to new subsurface sewage treatment systems or, if it cannot come into compliance the standards applicable to alterations or modifications of subsurface sewage treatment systems to the extent possible pursuant to 15 RCNY § 18-38(b)(4), for the proposed use and volume, shall be binding upon the Department for five years following the date of the determination.

(c) Design, operation, treatment, and maintenance requirements.

      (iv) For new subsurface sewage treatment systems within the 60-day travel time, and for new subsurface sewage treatment systems that require State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) permits, trench length reductions will not be offered for use of any enhanced subsurface sewage treatment systems.

      (v) No trench length reductions shall be granted for use of any open-bottom gravelless absorption system, as described in 10 NYCRR Appendix 75-A.8(c)(3)(i). One linear foot of a gravelless absorption system is equivalent to one linear foot of conventional (24" wide) absorption trench.

   (3) An additional area of at least 100 percent of the primary absorption field shall be set aside as a reserve absorption field for any subsurface sewage treatment system.

   (4) No part of any primary or reserve absorption field shall be built under pavement or other impervious surfaces, and pavement and other impervious surfaces shall not be built over such absorption fields after installation.

   (5) At least one percolation test and at least one deep hole test must be performed in the primary absorption field. At least one percolation test and at least one deep hole test must be performed in the reserve absorption field. An applicant must notify the Department in writing at least seven (7) days prior to performance of such tests, and specify the location and the time of the tests. Such soils testing must be performed during normal business hours on weekdays other than legal holidays. At the option of the Department, a Department representative may witness such tests.

   (6) Proposed sites with soil percolation rates faster than 3 minutes per inch or slower than 60 minutes per inch shall not be approved by the Department for locating a subsurface sewage treatment system.

   (7) Whenever possible, gravity flow systems shall be used for subsurface sewage treatment systems. The use of electrically operated pumps shall require a chamber equipped with an alarm to indicate malfunction and any other safety features required by the Department to prevent sewage overflow. An intermediate sized sewage treatment system that uses electrically operated pumps is required to have either a backup pump or a backup storage tank capable of holding two days' flow. An individual sewage treatment system that uses electrically operated pumps shall have a backup storage tank capable of holding one day's flow.

   (8) A reserve absorption field is intended to be left undisturbed to be used in the event that the primary absorption field fails in the future. If the reserve absorption field is used because the primary absorption field has failed, the owner should, but is not required to, identify a new reserve absorption field. If the reserve absorption field is used for purposes of expanding the subsurface sewage treatment system, a new reserve absorption field or Department-approved alternative must be identified.

   (3) Stormwater pollution prevention plans shall be prepared for the activities listed in subparagraph (4) of this subdivision. Such plans shall also be subject to the prior review and approval of the Department. Such plans shall be prepared and implemented in accordance with the requirements of Part III of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation SPDES General Permit No. GP-0-15-002 that are applicable to construction activities identified in Table 2 of Appendix B, and in accordance with the requirements of subdivision (c) of this section, except that:

      (i) plans for redevelopment shall be prepared and implemented in accordance with subdivision (b)(8),

      (ii) plans for construction activities identified in Table 1 of Appendix 18-B must be prepared and implemented in accordance with the requirements of Part III of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation SPDES General Permit No. GP-0-15-002 that are applicable to construction activities identified in Table 1 of Appendix 18-B. A construction activity will be deemed to "alter hydrology from pre to post development conditions," for purposes of Table 1 of Appendix 18-B, if the post-development peak rate of flow for the activity has increased by more than 5% of the pre-developed condition for the one-year, twenty-four hour storm, the ten-year, twenty-four hour storm, or the one hundred-year, twenty-four hour storm as defined herein. A construction activity that is excluded from coverage under Table 1 of Appendix 18-B because it alters hydrology from pre to post development conditions must comply with the requirements of subdivision (b)(3) above,

      (iii) plans for construction activities requiring Department review and approval of a stormwater pollution prevention plan under this section that involve disturbance of less than one (1) acre of total land area, other than construction of gasoline stations and construction, alteration, or modification of solid waste management facilities, and which will not result in hot spot runoff, must be prepared and implemented in accordance with subdivision (b)(9), and

      (iv) no activity shall be exempt from any such requirements as a result of the size or nature of the watercourse(s) to which stormwater from such activity discharges, except with prior written approval from the Department. Such plans shall also be subject to the prior review and approval of the Department.

   (4) The activities for which a stormwater pollution prevention plan must be prepared under subparagraph (3) of this subdivision are:

      (i) Plans for development or sale of land that will result in the disturbance of five (5) or more acres of total land area as described in the definition of larger common plan of development or sale in Appendix A of SPDES General Permit No. GP-0-15-002;

      (ii) Construction of an impervious surface for a new road, for an access road, or for an existing dirt or gravel road, as required by paragraph (a)(6) of this section;

   (5) If there is a significant change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance of an activity which is subject to a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan pursuant to subdivision (b)(3) which may have a significant effect on the potential for the discharge of pollutants to surface waters and which has not otherwise been addressed in the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan, or if the Stormwater Pollution Plan proves to be ineffective in eliminating or significantly minimizing erosion and sedimentation or the discharge of pollutants associated with construction activity, the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan must be amended. Such amended stormwater pollution prevention plan shall be submitted to the Department for prior review and approval and shall comply with the requirements of this section.

   (6) Any approval of a stormwater pollution prevention plan issued by the Department expires and is null and void unless construction is completed within five (5) years of the date of issuance or within any extended period of time approved by the Department upon good cause shown. Following expiration of the approval, the application for the stormwater pollution prevention plan may be resubmitted to the Department for consideration for a new approval.

   (7) As a condition of approval the Department may require evidence of financial security prior to construction from any owner or operator of a stormwater management system pursuant to a stormwater pollution prevention plan. Such financial security shall consist of a bond, or an equivalent guaranty, to be deposited with the Department, covering the full cost of the construction of such facility and an additional bond or an equivalent guaranty for the payment of labor and material furnished in the course of such construction. Upon completion of construction and payment of labor and materials, such bonds or other guaranties shall be released. Additionally, a bond or equivalent guaranty may be required for the maintenance and operation of the facility for a period of five years post-construction. No bond or guaranty is required where the owner or operator of such a facility is a village, town, county or city.

   (8) Where portions of an activity that require a stormwater pollution prevention plan pursuant to subdivision (b)(3) constitute redevelopment as defined herein, those portions of such plan shall:

      (i) be prepared and implemented, to the extent possible, in accordance with the requirements of Part III of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation SPDES General Permit No. GP-0-15-002 that are applicable to the construction activities identified in Table 2 of Appendix 18-B;

   (9) Where an activity requiring Department review and approval of a stormwater pollution prevention plan under this section that involves disturbance of less than one (1) acre of total land area, other than construction of a gasoline station or construction, alteration, or modification of a solid waste management facility, and which will not result in hot spot runoff, requires a stormwater pollution prevention plan pursuant to subdivision (b)(3) above, the application must consist of:

      (i) A plan of the proposed activity, identifying the area of disturbance, the location of any existing or proposed impervious surfaces, and the location of any watercourses, wetlands, reservoirs, reservoir stems or controlled lakes on or adjacent to the property;

      (ii) A description and depiction of proposed erosion controls sufficient to prevent sedimentation of the receiving watercourse, wetland, reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake on or adjacent to the property during construction. Erosion controls typically consist of sediment barriers, such as hay bales and silt fencing, temporary sediment traps and temporary stormwater flow diversions;

      (iii) A schedule for construction, including grading and site stabilization; and

      (iv) A description and depiction of proposed permanent stormwater management practices designed to filter, detain, or infiltrate runoff from impervious surfaces, thereby minimizing the post-construction increase in pollutant loading to the receiving watercourse, wetland, reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake.

(c) Additional Requirements for Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans.

   (1) When any activity listed in paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) of this section is proposed to be undertaken in the drainage basin of a terminal reservoir, as identified in the watershed maps in Appendix 18-A, the stormwater pollution prevention plan shall include analysis of coliform runoff, before and after the land disturbance activity.

      (i) If such proposed activity causes or contributes to the contravention of the coliform standard set forth in 15 RCNY § 18-48(b)(1), the stormwater pollution prevention plan shall not be approved by the Department, unless the measures required by the stormwater pollution prevention plan in conjunction with any other controls to be imposed that limit future land disturbance at the site, including but not limited to property easements, restrictive covenants, zoning laws and development by-laws, will prevent the contribution of additional coliform.

   (2) Stormwater Conveyance Measures. Stormwater pollution prevention plans prepared pursuant to this section shall provide for the maintenance of natural drainage systems, including perennial and intermittent streams, and the use of swales and drainage ditches in an open condition to the maximum extent practicable. A stormwater pollution prevention plan shall ensure that any closed stormwater conveyance measures are sized appropriately to convey, at a minimum, the 10-year, 24-hour storm flow.

   (3) Stormwater Treatment Volume. All stormwater pollution prevention plans prepared pursuant to this section shall include measures to capture and treat the greater of the volume of runoff generated by the 1-year, 24-hour storm or the Water Quality Volume (WQv), except that a stormwater management practice may be designed to capture and treat the lesser of those volumes if it is a stormwater infiltration practice or it is a bioretention practice in hydrologic soil group A or B. Stormwater management practices which provide treatment shall be designed to accommodate the quantity of runoff flowing to the stormwater management practice, including runoff from off-site areas.

   (4) Where a stormwater pollution prevention plan prepared pursuant to this section includes a stormwater infiltration practice, to the maximum extent practicable, no portion of such stormwater infiltration practice shall be located within 100 feet of any portion of the absorption field of a subsurface sewage treatment system.

   (5) To the maximum extent practicable, an activity requiring a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and the stormwater pollution prevention plan prepared for such activity, shall be designed:

      (i) To minimize the alteration of the existing drainage areas and to maintain the volumes of flow at design points at pre-construction levels, except as necessary to alleviate downstream flooding problems or other adverse conditions in existence prior to construction, or to divert runoff from off-site and/or undisturbed areas away from areas proposed to be disturbed.

      (ii) To minimize loss of annual recharge to groundwater by maximizing the use of stormwater infiltration practices where suitable soil conditions exist.

   (6) If an activity requiring a stormwater pollution prevention plan will result in impervious surfaces covering twenty percent (20%) or more of the drainage area for which a stormwater management practice is designed, the stormwater pollution prevention plan shall provide for stormwater runoff from that drainage area to be treated by two different types of stormwater management practices in series, except that only one stormwater management practice is required if either:

      (i) the stormwater management practice provided is a stormwater infiltration practice; or

      (ii) the activity requiring a stormwater pollution prevention plan is in the West of Hudson watershed within a village, hamlet, village extension, or area zoned for commercial or industrial uses or in the East of Hudson watershed within a Designated Main Street Area.

   (7) For purposes of the design criteria incorporated by reference in New York State Department of Environmental Conservation SPDES General Permit No. GP-0-15-002, "detention time" shall mean the time runoff is detained in a stormwater management practice. It can be computed using either the center of mass method or the plug flow method.

(a)  The Commissioner may, in his or her discretion, upon written application from the applicant, grant a variance from the requirements of these rules and regulations for a regulated activity and for the alteration or modification of a noncomplying regulated activity.

   (1) An application for a variance for a regulated activity or for an alteration or modification of a noncomplying regulated activity shall:

      (i) Identify the specific provision of the rules and regulations from which the variance is sought or identify the nature and extent of the alteration or modification of the noncomplying regulated activity;

      (ii) Demonstrate that the variance requested is the minimum necessary to afford relief; and

      (iii) Demonstrate that the activity as proposed includes adequate mitigation measures to avoid contamination to or degradation of the water supply which are at least as protective of the water supply as the standards for regulated activities set forth in these rules and regulations.

   (2) In granting variances the Commissioner may impose specific conditions, including evidence of financial security, time limitations and limitations on any transfer of the variance granted. In addition, the Commissioner may grant a lesser variance than that applied for.

   (3) Any proposed substantial alteration or modification of an activity that has been granted a variance under this Subchapter shall require the review and approval of the Department and shall comply with the provisions of this Subchapter.

   (4) The burden of proof for a variance shall be on the applicant.

   (5) Except for a variance granted for an alteration or modification of a noncomplying regulated activity, a grant of a variance for a regulated activity shall not be deemed to make such activity a noncomplying regulated activity under these rules and regulations.

(b) An appeal of a denial of a variance for a regulated activity or a denial of a variance for an alteration or modification of a noncomplying regulated activity may be made in the manner specified in 15 RCNY § 18-28.

(c) Failure to comply with any condition of a variance for a regulated activity, or for a variance for an alteration or modification of a noncomplying regulated activity shall be a violation of these rules and regulations. The Department shall review the terms and conditions of each variance granted at least once every five years to determine whether the terms and conditions of the variance have been complied with.

(d) Variances within coliform and phosphorus restricted basins.

   (1) The Department may grant a variance from the prohibition of locating a new wastewater treatment plant or expanding an existing wastewater treatment plant in a coliform restricted basin, or in a phosphorus restricted basin, where the Department determines that conditions in the area to be served by the new or expanded wastewater treatment plant are resulting in the release or discharge of inadequately treated sewage into the water supply, and that there is no other feasible method of correcting such release or discharge of inadequately treated sewage except to provide a variance from such prohibition. Provided, however, that in such cases, the additional treatment capacity of the new or expanded wastewater treatment plant may only be of a size sufficient to service the area identified as the source of contamination and any immediate area of concern as limited or delineated by the Department.

   (2) A request for a variance from the prohibition of expanding an existing wastewater treatment plant located in a phosphorus restricted basin which does not meet the criteria set forth in subdivision (d)(1) may be granted only if the applicant demonstrates that subsurface discharge is impossible and that every one (1) kilogram of projected increase in the phosphorus load resulting from the expansion of the existing wastewater treatment plant and accompanying non-point source runoff, is offset by two (2) kilograms of reductions in phosphorus loading within such basin provided by enhanced treatment, basin-wide phosphorus trading, and/or a watershed protection plan developed pursuant to Subchapter H.

(e) Variances Within the 60 Day Travel Time to Intake in the Croton System.

   (1) The Department may grant a variance from the prohibition set forth in 15 RCNY § 18-36(d)(2)(i) against locating a new wastewater treatment plant or expanding an existing wastewater treatment plant in the Croton System, within the 60 day travel time to intake, where the Department has made the following determinations:

      (i) One of the following situations is present:

         (a) conditions in the area to be served by the new or expanded wastewater treatment plant, including failed subsurface sewage treatment systems, are resulting in the release or discharge of inadequately treated sewage into the water supply; or

         (b) influent flow rates to an existing wastewater treatment plant exceed the permitted flow limit for the wastewater treatment plant as specified in its SPDES permit and/or the design capacity of the wastewater treatment plant and have caused, or can reasonably be expected to cause, the release of inadequately treated sewage.

      (ii) There is no other feasible method of correcting such release or discharge of inadequately treated sewage except by locating a new or expanding an existing surface-discharging wastewater treatment plant within the 60 day travel time to intake; and

      (iii) The applicant has demonstrated that there are no sources of inflow or infiltration to the sewer system of the new or expanded wastewater treatment plant, other than sources that are to be eliminated pursuant to a consent order or other commitment binding on the applicant, that can practicably be eliminated.

   (2) The applicant must demonstrate to the Department, that the total flow to the new or expanded wastewater treatment plant authorized pursuant to this subdivision will be limited as follows:

      (i) if the applicant seeks to expand a wastewater treatment plant serving a sewer district, the flow to the expanded wastewater treatment plant may include only:

         (a) flow from facilities within the sewer district that are connected to the wastewater treatment plant as of the date of the application for a variance (based on the flows reported by the wastewater treatment plant pursuant to its SPDES permit in the year preceding the application for the variance); and

         (b) flow from facilities within the sewer district that are served by subsurface sewage treatment systems as of the date of the application for a variance; and

         (c) additional flow of no more than ten percent (10%) of the average of the flows reported by the wastewater treatment plant pursuant to its SPDES permit in the year preceding the application for the variance to be allocated within the sewer district; and

         (d) reasonably anticipated flows from any area(s) outside the sewer district identified as source(s) of contamination pursuant to clause (a) of subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (e) of this section.

      (ii) if the applicant seeks to expand a wastewater treatment plant without a sewer district, the flow to the expanded wastewater treatment plant may include only:

*§ 18-82 Watershed Planning in the Croton System.*


(a)  Notwithstanding the prohibitions set forth in 15 RCNY § 18-36 on new or expanded wastewater treatment plants with surface discharges within the sixty day travel time to intake or within phosphorus restricted basins, the Department shall allow for the preparation and implementation of a Comprehensive Croton System Water Quality Protection Plan ("Croton Plan") and an accompanying phosphorus offset program and diversion credit program in accordance with this 15 RCNY § 18-82. 15 RCNY § 18-82 is independent of, does not govern, and is not governed by, 15 RCNY § 18-81.

(b) (1) At the request of Dutchess, Putnam or Westchester County, and in partnership with Dutchess, Putnam or Westchester County, and the municipalities located in the Croton system watershed, the Department shall prepare or assist in the preparation of a Croton Plan only in a participating County or Counties which:

      (i) Identifies significant sources of pollution to the Croton system;

      (ii) Recommends measures to be taken by the Department, the Counties, and the municipalities which, in conjunction with other federal, State, local and Department water quality protection programs, will prevent degradation to, and improve, water quality, with the long term goal of attaining water quality standards in the Croton system; and

      (iii) Recommends measures to be taken to protect the character and special needs of communities located within the watershed.

   (2) A County wishing to do so may, when joined by a majority of municipalities located within the County's watershed, choose to prepare the Croton Plan for the portion of the watershed located within the County. Such Croton Plan shall be prepared in partnership with the Department.

   (3) The Croton Plan shall be developed in the manner set forth in subdivisions (c), (d) and (e) below and may allow for new wastewater treatment plants with a surface discharge or for the expansion of existing wastewater treatment plants with a surface discharge, provided the additional flow is either offset by a diversion of wastewater off of the watershed pursuant to subparagraph (e)(4)(i), or the additional phosphorus load is offset pursuant to subparagraph (e)(4)(ii).

   (4) Any data that would benefit the Croton Planning process that is in the possession of the Department or one of the Counties or municipalities participating in the development of a Croton Plan shall be shared among the participants and appropriately considered in developing a Croton Plan.

(c) The Croton Plan shall consist of the following three elements:

   (1) Identification of water quality problems and community character needs. Such identification shall include the following elements:

      (i) An identification of growth or development projected to occur under existing municipal zoning and master plans and allowed under existing land use controls, other than these rules and regulations, and including development necessary to maintain community character, public facilities and institutions and to serve local, regional or special needs;

      (ii) An identification of specific existing water quality problem areas and specific sources of pollution to the Croton system, including areas of existing or imminent subsurface sewage treatment system failures, areas of concentrated point source discharges and substantial non-point source pollution, and areas in need of streambank stabilization.

      (iii) An assessment of future water quality impacts related to growth or development identified in paragraph (i) above.

      (iv) An identification of areas identified in paragraph (i) above where site constraints may prevent the siting of new subsurface sewage treatment systems in accordance with the requirements set forth in these rules and regulations.

      (v) An identification of areas identified in paragraph (i) above where these rules and regulations prohibit new surface discharges from wastewater treatment plants and site constraints prevent the siting of a new wastewater treatment plant with a subsurface discharge.

   (2) Identification of investments to correct existing water quality problems in accordance with developed priorities. Such identification shall include the following elements:

      (i) The identified investments may include investments (i.e., capital projects and best management practices) implemented during the development of the Croton Plan, investments that the participating Counties and municipalities commit to implement, and an identification of priorities for future investments, without any commitment on the part of the Counties and municipalities to implement such investments.

      (ii) Proposed measures to address water quality problems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) above. Such measures may include subsurface sewage treatment system maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement programs, installation of community septic systems, the construction of sewer extensions or new sewer systems, stormwater controls, and the permanent diversion of wastewater to a discharge point outside of the watershed.

   (3) Strategies for prevention of future water quality problems and the consideration of future community character needs in conjunction with the water quality goals of the Croton Plan. Such strategies shall include the following:

      (i) An assessment of the economic, water quality, community character, and special needs impacts of directing growth away from areas identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv) and (v) above;

      (ii) An identification of the economic, water quality and community character impacts of allowing growth within those areas identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (iv) and (v) above, if directing growth in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i) above is not feasible or practical;

      (iii) An identification of potential areas for the construction of new or expanded wastewater treatment plants, as provided for in (e) below, either under a future permanent phosphorus offset program or utilizing the 10 percent credit provision for an implemented diversion project and a statement of the reasoning for the selection of such potential areas;

      (iv) An identification of land use and local laws and regulations that the participating Counties and municipalities have already implemented and/or agree to implement in the future which are intended, in combination with other measures in the Croton Plan, to mitigate the water quality impacts identified in subsection (c)(1)(iii) above;

      (v) With respect to future land use issues, identification of mechanisms to ensure the improvement and protection of water quality is taken into consideration by the local government and that the local government agrees to use best efforts to implement such mechanisms; and

      (vi) At the option of the local government, designation of "village centers" as provided for in 15 RCNY § 18-39(a)(7)(i).

(d) (1) If a County requests, pursuant to 15 RCNY § 18-82(b), that a Croton Plan be developed within five (5) years of the effective date of these rules and regulations, the Department, in partnership with the participating Counties and municipalities, and in consultation with the New York State Department of Health, shall complete a draft Croton Plan and release such draft Croton Plan for public review and comment. If a Croton Plan has been prepared by a County and its municipalities, the County and municipalities, in partnership with the Department and in consultation with the New York State Department of Health, shall complete a draft Croton Plan within five (5) years of the effective date of these rules and regulations and release such draft Croton Plan for public review and comment. The Department, the participating Counties and municipalities shall consider and respond to comments received from the public in preparing the final Croton Plan.

   (2) Within six (6) months after the release of the draft Croton Plan, the final Croton Plan shall be agreed to by the Department and the Counties and municipalities which participated in the preparation of the Croton Plan, and in consultation with the New York State Department of Health. In determining whether to agree to the Croton Plan, the Department will consider the Croton Plan, including the level of commitments therein, taken as a whole and consistent with subsection (d) of this section, meets the overall goals of the Croton Plan, set forth in subsection (b) of this section. The Department will not approve or disapprove individual components of the Croton Plan. The Department and the participating Counties and municipalities shall make a reasonable effort to resolve any and all issues which preclude their agreement to the Croton Plan. The five (5) year period referred to in paragraph (1) above, and/or the six (6) month period referred to in this paragraph (2) may be extended by agreement of the Department and the participating Counties and municipalities. In addition, the participating Counties and municipalities may, at any time, agree to discontinue the development of the Croton Plan.

   (3) A failure of any participating County or municipality to agree to the Croton Plan shall not affect the ability of another participating County or municipality to agree to the Croton Plan and to site new wastewater treatment plants or to expand existing wastewater treatment plants with a surface discharge in accordance with subdivision (e).

   (4) Once the Croton Plan is agreed to by the Department and the participating Counties and municipalities, the Croton Plan shall be considered valid and effective. The participating Counties and municipalities agreeing to the Croton Plan may, upon 60 days written notice to the City, modify the Plan at any time after it has been agreed upon. If the Croton Plan is proposed to be modified, the Department shall make a determination within sixty (60) days of notice of the proposed modification, whether the Croton Plan, as modified, shall continue to be valid and effective. In making such a determination, the Department shall consider whether the Croton Plan, as modified and taken as a whole, is consistent with subsection (d) of this section and meets the overall goals of the Croton Plan set forth in subsection (b) of this section. Any approved Croton Plan remains in effect pending any determination on a proposed modification and shall remain in effect until and unless either the Department agrees to a modification or a local government modifies it without the Department's approval or ceases to implement it.

   (5) Any Croton Plan agreed to shall be reviewed by the participants to the plan fifteen (15) years after the Croton Plan becomes effective in order to determine whether the Croton Plan has met and will continue to meet its goals, and to determine whether new goals are appropriate.

      (i) A statement of the status of the developmnt or implementation of measures proposed in the Croton Plan;

      (ii) A statement of expenditures incurred by the Counties and municipalities in implementing, and administering measures proposed in the Croton Plan; and

      (iii) An identification of the financial, personnel and other resources needed to continue implementation and administration of the measures proposed in the Croton Plan.

(e) The Croton Plan may allow for the siting of a new wastewater treatment plant with a surface discharge or the expansion of an existing wastewater treatment plant with a surface discharge in the Croton system within a phosphorus restricted basin or a basin located within the 60 day travel time, but not within a coliform restricted basin, pursuant to the following conditions:

   (1) Site constraints prevent the proposed new wastewater treatment plant or the expanded existing wastewater treatment plant from discharging subsurface;

   (2) The municipal government and the County in which the wastewater treatment plant would be sited, confirms in writing that the proposed new wastewater treatment plant or the expansion of an existing wastewater treatment plant is consistent with the Croton Plan;

   (3) The Department, in consultation with the New York State Department of Health, determines that the proposed new wastewater treatment plant or expansion of an existing wastewater treatment plant is consistent with the water quality objectives of the Croton Plan; and

   (4) The discharge from the new wastewater treatment plant or the expansion of an existing wastewater treatment plant complies with one of the following conditions:

      (i) The total volume (or flow) of surface discharge from such new wastewater treatment plant or expansion of an existing wastewater treatment plant, together with the total volume of surface discharges from all other new wastewater treatment plants and expansions of wastewater treatment plants which have been permitted in the subject County pursuant to this subparagraph (i), shall not, in the aggregate, exceed 10 percent of the total volume (or flow) of surface discharge from wastewater treatment plants located in the Croton system, within the subject County, which previously discharged into the Croton system but have been permanently diverted, since the effective date of these rules and regulations, to a discharge point outside of the Watershed. The Department may approve applications to construct new wastewater treatment plants with surface discharges pursuant to this subdivision prior to the permanent diversion of wastewater, and allow construction to begin on such new wastewater treatment plants, provided that the wastewater treatment plant may not commence operation until the diversion for which the credit is received has actually occurred.

   (5) With respect to any new or expanded wastewater treatment plant allowed pursuant to this subdivision (e), the Department will not impose additional requirements on the siting of such new or expanded wastewater treatment plant other than the requirements specifically set forth in these rules and regulations applicable to all wastewater treatment plants, the requirements of this subdivision (e), and, with respect to new or expanded wastewater treatment plants in phosphorus restricted basins relying on phosphorus offsets, the requirements of any phosphorus offset program pursuant to 15 RCNY §§ 18-82(g), 18-83(a) and 18-84.

(f) (1) A County or municipality wishing to participate in the preparation of the Croton Plan shall indicate its intention to participate by written notice to the Department given within one year of the effective date of these rules and regulations. Such notice shall include a commitment by the subject County or municipality to cooperate with the Department in generating and analyzing the data and information reasonably necessary to address the Croton Plan elements identified in subdivision (c) above, and an agreement to minimize the use of offsets as a basis for new wastewater treatment plants or expansions of existing wastewater treatment plants pursuant to subdivision (e), to the extent that the economic and social needs of such County or municipality can be reasonably addressed without the use of such offsets.

   (2) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of a notice as described in subdivision (f)(1) above, the Department shall notify a County or municipality of its inclusion in the preparation of a Croton Plan.

   (3) If a County and its municipalities wish to prepare a Croton Plan, in accordance with subdivision (b)(2) above, the Department shall, within thirty (30) days of receipt of a notice as described in subdivision (f)(1) above, authorize the County and municipalities to begin preparation of such a Croton Plan. Such authorization shall include a commitment by the Department to cooperate with the County and municipalities in generating the data and information reasonably necessary to address the Croton Plan elements identified in subdivision (c) above.

   (4) The provisions of subdivision (e) above shall not apply in any County or municipality which fails to participate in the preparation of the Croton Plan, fails to cooperate with the Department in the manner described in paragraph (f)(1) above in preparing the Croton Plan; fails or ceases to implement any water quality protection measures which such County or municipality has committed to implement as part of the final Croton Plan agreed upon by the County, municipality and the Department; or where a previously agreed upon Croton Plan is no longer valid and effective.

(g) Nothing in this Subpart is intended to constrain, limit or preclude an applicant from seeking, or the Department from issuing, approval of or a variance for a proposed regulated activity under any other applicable provision of these rules and regulations.

(h) Nothing in this section or in the Croton Plan is intended to constrain or limit the authority of local governments under State law to make local land use and zoning decisions, and nothing in this section or the Croton Plan should be construed to have the effect of transferring such local land use and zoning authority from the participating local governments to the Department or any other entity.

(b) (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in 15 RCNY § 19-04(a) above, when the volume of a single toxic discharge or the combined toxic discharges of a group of establishments within a single drainage area is large enough, in the opinion of the Commissioner, to create unacceptable total concentrations of a toxic substance either in the influent entering a sewage treatment plant or in the receiving waters, the Commissioner may by order impose more stringent concentration limits than those listed in 15 RCNY § 19-04(a), or impose mass limits upon the person or persons so discharging. Conversely, when a toxic discharge is sufficiently diluted or rendered innocuous before reaching a sewage treatment plant or the receiving waters, the Commissioner may, in his absolute discretion, grant written permission for discharge concentrations greater than those listed in 15 RCNY § 19-04(a).

   (2) The Commissioner may by order impose maximum amounts or concentrations of a toxic substance which may be discharged directly or indirectly to a public sewer from an industrial source notwithstanding that such amounts or concentrations are less than those demanded by other subdivisions of this section or that the substance is not regulated by such subdivisions for that source, provided that such amounts or concentrations are economically achievable by that source as determined by the Commissioner. Within 20 days after service of the Commissioner's determination and order, the person discharging the toxic substance may request a hearing at which evidence may be presented only upon the issue of the economic achievability of the maximum amounts or concentrations of the toxic substance, as imposed by the Commissioner, to be discharged to the public sewer. Following such hearing, the hearing officer designated by the Commissioner shall report his findings and recommendations to the Commissioner who, in his discretion, may sustain, revoke, or modify his original determination and order. The Commissioner shall, upon his decision to sustain or modify his original determination and order, issue a final order to the person discharging the toxic substance to comply with such decision.

(c) Pursuant to § 24-523(e)(2) of the Administrative Code, all pretreatment standards and requirements promulgated pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act, as amended, including time limitations for compliance with such standards, monitoring of wastewater and the reporting of the results of such monitoring are hereby incorporated into these regulations and all such reports shall also be made to the Commissioner. All sources of pollutants or toxic substances to the public sewers, subject to such pretreatment standards, shall discharge wastewaters to the public sewers in conformance with such standards, provided however, that if a more stringent standard is applicable under 15 RCNY §§ 19-04(a) or 19-04(b) or any other section of these Regulations then the said more stringent standard shall be controlling.

(d) Pretreatment systems shall be maintained in good working order and operated properly so as to insure continued compliance with 15 RCNY §§ 19-03 and 19-04.

(e) No person shall increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute means of pretreatment in order to comply with any provision of any section of these Regulations.

*§ 19-08 House and Trailer Connections.*


(a) Conditional house connection. 

   (1) Conditional House Connection Permits are issued under a variety of situations among which the two (2) most common are:

      (i) The Developer/Builder does not have a Prospectus at the time house connection permits have to be issued as consequence of a hardship.

      (ii) The Developer/Builder does not have a Prospectus which is most likely early on in the construction sequence of his Building Construction, however needs one or several connections to drain his construction site.

   (2) The manner in which conditional House Connection Permits are issued is as follows: The Local Office will approve a Permit Application conditionally by indicating on it that the Certificate of Inspections are not to be released until a Prospectus has been secured.

(b) Trailer connections. Basically there are two types of trailer connections:

   (1) A construction trailer that is necessitated by the construction of a Building. The trailer connection(s) in such a case should be tied in with the certification of the Site Connection Proposal and the issuance of the House Connections Permits for this building as follows:

      (i) The Plumber requesting the trailer connection should present a copy of the certified Site Connection Proposal with his Permit Application.

      (ii) The Local Office will issue a house connection permit subject to the following condition: We will withhold the Certificate of Inspection for at least one of the Buildings House Connections until the plug for the trailer connection is performed.

   (2) If the construction trailer is necessitated by D.O.T. (or any other Agency's) Capital Project the plumber should present an original letter from D.O.T. (or any other Agency) to D.E.P. indicating the following:

      (i) The number and size of connections needed.

      (ii) The duration of the construction operations at the end of which the plumber will plug the trailer connection(s).

      (iii) Guarantee from D.O.T. (or any other Agency) that the Plumber will obtain a plug permit(s) at the end of their construction operations to plug the trailer connection(s). The Local Office will not issue any other trailer connections to the agency in question if it is common knowledge that a job has been completed and there are outstanding open connections.

(c) BSA letter. Letters to the Board of Standards and Appeals for situations where there are no allowable storm/combined sewer outlets for storm discharge within 500 feet will be sent out upon verification by D.E.P. provided: The filing Engineer/Architect requests such a letter and encloses the following:

   (1) NB/BN/ALT numbers

   (2) Street address

   (3) Block &amp; Lot

   (4) Site Plans

   (5) Tentative Lot Sheets

   (6) Survey

(d) House connection charges (private sewers).

   (1) For private sewers that are still recoupable. (meaning either/or:

      (i) All property owners abutting the sewer have not paid their proportionate part of the sewer cost for sewers built prior to 1963)

      (ii) For sewers where the Construction Permits were obtained after January 1, 1963 the seven year period is not up and all the abutting property have not paid their share of the private sewer cost.)

   (2) The following procedure is to be followed:

      (i) Case I (Plumber has "Consent Letter"). At the time of applying for the House Connection Permit the Plumber will present the "Proof of Payment Letter" (Sewer Owner's Consent Letter) to the Local Office of the Permit Control Section in order to be able to connect to the Private Sewer.

      (ii) Case II (Missing Sewer Owner). At the time of applying for the House Connection Permit the plumber will present the following additional documents:

(A) Registered Letter Envelope with Post Office Stamp: Return to sender not at this address or something similar. (The addressee on the envelope should be the latest address we have on record which would prove that an attempt was made to contact the sewer owner.)

(B) A properly executed Missing Owner Affidavit.

(C) A House Connection Bond for a six year period which should be the House Connection Charge to the Private Sewer plus 25 percent (the computation of the House Connection Charge is determined/provided by the Local Office).

      (iii) Case III (House Connection Charge Dispute with Sewer Owner). At the time of applying for the House Connection Permit the plumber will present the following additional documents:

(A) A properly executed "Fee in Dispute Affidavit".

(B) A House Connection Bond for a six year period which should be the House Connection Charge to the Private Sewer plus 25 percent (the computation of the House Connection Charge is determined/provided by the Local Office).

These procedures concern all information submitted to the Department pursuant to either the New York City Department of Environmental Protection rules and regulations relating to the use of the Public Sewers or to §§ 24-501 et seq. of Chapter 5 of Title 24 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York. All requests for confidentiality will be evaluated in accordance with Article 6 of the New York State Public Officers Law.

(b) Submission of Business Confidentiality Claims ("Claims") in Response to Requests for Information by the Department.

   (1) Method and time to assert a claim. A business may assert a claim concerning information requested by the Department, by placing a cover sheet, stamped legend or any other suitable form of notice on the information, employing language such as "trade secret", "proprietary" or "company confidential" at the time such information is submitted. Allegedly confidential parts of otherwise non-confidential documents should be clearly marked as such. Effluent data, as defined in Part 2.302 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, cannot be treated as confidential.

   (2) Failure to submit a timely claim. If a business submits information in response to a Department request, without a claim accompanying such information at the time it is received by the Department, the Department need not make further inquiries to the business concerning confidentiality of the submitted information; the information may be made available for public inspection. If a claim is submitted after the Department has received the information, the Department may make efforts that are administratively practicable to process the late claim with the previously submitted information.

(c) Department requests for comments and their submission by claimants.

   (1) The Department shall give written notice to each business asserting a claim, in accordance with 15 RCNY § 19-09(b)(1), stating that written comments, as described in 15 RCNY § 19-09(c)(5), must be submitted no later than 15 business days after receipt by the business of the request for comments. The request for comments will indicate the address of the appropriate Department official to whom comments should be sent, and will also state that failure to submit timely comments will be construed as a waiver of the claim. This notice by the Department shall be made in such a manner that the fact and date of receipt may be verified.

   (2) The comment period may be extended, if, before comments are due, a written request for an extension has been made and approved by the Department.

   (3) If disclosure of information under a claim would be helpful in alleviating a situation posing an imminent and substantial danger to public health or safety, the Department may prescribe and make known to an affected business a shorter comment period that it finds necessary under the circumstances.

   (4) Information submitted by a business as part of its comments, pertaining to its claim, will be treated as part of the claim.

   (5) Written notice will invite comments on:

      (i) the period of time for which confidential treatment is desired;

      (ii) the extent to which the information has been disclosed to others and any measures or precautions taken to guard against undesired disclosure;

      (iii) whether any other governmental agency determination or any judicial decision has held the claimed information to be confidential. If so, a copy of such determination or decision, if available, must be included; and

      (iv) whether the business asserts that disclosure would be likely to result in substantial harmful effects on their competitive position, what those harmful effects would be, and why they should be viewed as substantial. The reasons why the information is considered to be confidential (i.e. why the information should be regarded as a trade secret or proprietary information) must be stated in detail.

(d) Non-final recommendation by the Department. When a business submits information to the Department that is claimed to be confidential, the Department shall consider the claim and comments, previously issued determinations, material submitted to the Department in response to requests, applicable substantive criteria and any other material that it finds appropriate. The Department will make a non-final recommendation as to whether or not the information should be treated as confidential and this recommendation shall be forwarded to the designated Records Access Officer upon request.

(e) Final confidentiality determination. When notified of a request, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Law, for any claimed information, the Records Access Officer shall issue a final confidentiality determination. If it is determined that the information should not be treated as confidential, the affected business shall be notified (in writing) by the Records Access Officer of that determination and that a request for the release of such information has been made. Notice shall also state the date that the information will be released. If the Records Access Officer decides to treat the information as confidential, the request for release of the information shall be denied.

Note: Aggregate volume is the maximum volume (e.g. length times width times height to the overflow if rectangular) in cubic inches of all fixtures, vessels and receptables that may flow simultaneously through the interceptor. * Subject to the sizing requirements specified in 15 RCNY § 19-11(i) through (p). If a premises contains fixtures listed in Table I and fixtures, vessels and/or receptacles listed in Table II, all of which are tributary to the same grease interceptor, then the method for determining the minimum grease interceptor retaining capacity, in pounds, shall be to separately calculate the retaining capacities for the fixtures in Table I, and the fixtures, vessels and/or receptacles in Table II. These retaining capacities shall then be added together to obtain the total minimum grease interceptor retaining capacity required for such premises. If the aggregate volumes listed in Tables I and II are exceeded then a New York State Licensed Professional Engineer or a New York State Registered Architect shall extrapolate the appropriate grease interceptor sizing requirements.

(d) Vented flow control fittings shall be installed to insure that the flow capacity of the grease interceptor, as specified by the manufacturer, is not exceeded. Flow-control valves and/or fittings that are manually adjustable may not be used to limit flow to an interceptor.

(e) Grease interceptors must have a retention capacity, in pounds, of at least twice the numerical flow through rating in gallons per minute.

(f) Grease interceptors shall remove an average of 90 percent or more of the grease or other extractable matter in the wastewater.

(g) The temperature of water entering a grease interceptor shall not exceed 180°F.

(h) All grease interceptors must be readily accessible for inspection by duly authorized employees of the Department.

(i) Grease interceptors for scraper sinks shall be sized in accordance with Table II, except that the minimum retaining capacity shall be at least 30 pounds. When determining the aggregate volume of all fixtures, vessels and receptacles specified in Table II that may flow simultaneously through an interceptor, a minimum of 3,465 cubic inches, per scraper sink, shall be used.

(j) Discharges from automatic dishwashers must be tributary to a grease interceptor. Whether connected separately or in conjunction with other fixtures, the total volume, in gallons, of each automatic dishwasher shall be converted to cubic inches and added to the aggregate volume of Table II.

(k) Discharges from high-temperature sanitizer cycles of automatic dishwashers or from dedicated sanitization compartments of sinks need not be tributary to a grease interceptor.

(l) Floor drains which may receive grease must be tributary to a grease interceptor. The size of such grease interceptor shall be determined as follows:

   (1) For floor drains where grease may be discharged during washdowns, Table I shall be used and an additional 1,540 cubic inches, per floor drain, shall be added to the aggregate volume.

   (2) Grease interceptors for floor drains, which receive discharges directly from fixtures, receptacles and/or vessels, shall be sized in accordance with the grease interceptor sizing requirements for the fixtures, vessels and/or receptacles tributary to it.

   (3) For floor drains having a diameter larger than 3 inches or for trench and/or trough drains, a New York State Licensed Professional Engineer or a New York State Registered Architect shall extrapolate the appropriate sizing requirements of the tributary grease interceptor based on (1) and/or (2) above.

(m) For soup and/or stock kettles, the calculation of aggregate volume to be used in Table II shall be made based upon the total volume of all soup and stock kettles tributary to the grease interceptor, even if discharges from these vessels are made to a floor drain or similar fixture.

(n) Where woks, either alone or in conjunction with other types of fixtures are tributary to a grease interceptor, each wok shall be deemed to contribute 1,617 cubic inches to the aggregate volume of Table II.

(o) Discharges from the cleaning of kitchen hoods, which may extract grease from cooking operations, must be made to receptacles or floor drains that are tributary to a grease interceptor. The sizing of the tributary grease interceptor must account for such discharges using standard engineering practice. For kitchen hoods with automatic rinse cycles, the tributary grease interceptor must be sized to account for the peak flow from the automatic rinse cycle as specified by the manufacturer.

(p) Interceptors smaller than those described in Tables I and II may be used, but only if connected in parallel to another interceptor(s), and the aggregate capacity of such interceptors must either equal or exceed the interceptor capacity required by Tables I and/or II. For parallel connections, vented flow control fixtures must be installed on each interceptor.

(q) Grease interceptors shall be properly installed, maintained and operated, to insure that the requirements of this section and other applicable sections of the regulations are met. This shall include routine cleaning and grease removal from the interceptor, as needed to insure the proper operation of the interceptors.

(r) New York State Licensed Professional Engineers and New York State Registered Architects may petition the Commissioner, in writing, for acceptance of an alternate pretreatment device, technology, equipment, or procedures varying from, but equivalent to, those listed in this section. Such a petition must contain detailed documentation and calculations substantiating their equivalency. In no event shall any alternative pretreatment device, technology, equipment or procedures be less stringent than the requirements of this section.

(s) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, (1) existing grease interceptors shall conform to the specific requirements of this section no later than one year after the effective date of this section and (2) grease interceptors installed after the effective date of this section pursuant to an application filed before such effective date shall conform to the specific requirements of this section no later than 90 days after such effective date.

(t) Notwithstanding anything contained in 15 RCNY § 19-11 the Commissioner, in his discretion, may require any grease interceptor to be installed, at any time, and to have a retention capacity equal to those listed in Tables I and/or II.

*§ 20-02 Taps to City Water Mains.*


(a)  Separate supply. A separate corporation stop (tap) and service pipe shall be installed for each building supplied with City water, except for buildings that have service pipes supplied by internal water mains as described in 15 RCNY § 20-03(b). One tax lot cannot be supplied with water from another tax lot. Siamese corporation stops (taps) or service pipes on the inlet side of the main house control valve are prohibited. A service pipe connected to the City main by a T-connection, or by any means other than a corporation stop (tap) or a wet connection, shall be controlled by a gate valve placed in the service pipe, and located within two (2) feet of the point of connection to the main.

(b) Connections to city mains.

   (1) Corporation stops (taps) and wet connections to a City Main shall be inserted or installed only by Department employees. Waivers may be granted for T-connections in extenuating circumstances (i.e. connections to two (2) inch mains and two (2) or three (3) inch connections to a four (4) inch main).

   (2) A two (2) or three (3) inch connection to any main four (4) inches in diameter or less shall be made by a T-Connection with an adjacent valve.

   (3) Direct corporation stop connections (taps) shall not exceed one (1) inch in diameter for mains four (4) inches or less in diameter. Each one and one-half (11/2) inch corporation stop connection (tap) to such a main shall be made through a tapping saddle, as directed by the Department. The tapping saddle is to be provided and set by the Licensed Master Plumber.

   (4) Direct corporation stop connections (taps) shall not exceed one and one-half (11/2) inches in diameter for six (6) inch mains. Larger connections to mains of this size shall be wet connections.

   (5) Direct corporation stop connections (taps) shall not exceed two (2) inches in diameter for all mains larger than six (6) inches in diameter. All connections larger than two (2) inches shall be wet connections.

   (6) Tapping saddles shall be provided by the Licensed Master Plumber whenever, in the opinion of the Department, a pipe to be tapped lacks sufficient wall thickness to securely hold the corporation stop (tap).

(c) Spacing of corporations stops (taps) and wet connections.

   (1) No corporation stop (tap) or wet connection shall be inserted on a fitting or within twenty-four (24) inches of a hub, fitting, hydrant branch, dead end, etc.

   (2) The minimum spacing interval for corporation stops (taps) and wet connections shall be twelve (12) inches for both three quarter (3/4) inch and one (1) inch corporation stops (taps), and eighteen (18) inches for one and one-half (1 1/2) and two (2) inch corporation stops (taps) and wet connections.

   (3) No corporation stop (tap) or wet connection shall be installed below the horizontal diameter of the main.

(d) Location of corporation stops (taps) and wet connections. Water main corporation stops (taps) or wet connections shall be installed in front of the property to be supplied with water. All old taps or wet connections shall be plugged or destroyed prior to the installation of the new tap or wet connection, unless interruption of service to building occupants dictates that installation of the new tap or wet connection be completed prior to plugging or destroying the old tap or wet connection.

(e) Charges for corporation stops (taps) and wet connections. The charges for the installation of a corporation stop (tap) or a wet connection shall be as fixed by the New York City Water Board Water and Wastewater Rate Schedule.

(f) Permits at job site. Permits for corporation stops (taps), wet connections and plugs shall be displayed at the work site.

(g) Plugs. If an approved excavation for the removal or destruction of a single corporation stop (tap) reveals that the service pipe is supplied by two (2) or more corporation stops (taps), the Licensed Master Plumber making the excavation shall plug or destroy the additional corporation stops (taps). The Department will make its records relative to the location of any corporation stop (tap) to be plugged or destroyed available to the licensed plumber. The Licensed Master Plumber shall be solely responsible for locating the corporation stop (tap). A separate permit will be required for each corporation stop (tap) destroyed.

(h) Destruction of wet connections, corporation stops (taps) and three-way connections.

   (1) Destruction of a wet connection shall be performed by the Licensed Master Plumber engaged by the owner or the owner's duly authorized representative. The valve shall be closed, the stuffing box gland thoroughly tightened, the valve stem cut off flush with the stuffing box gland, the service pipe disconnected, and a plug inserted in the outlet end of the valve. The plug and wet connection valve shall be anchored to the main as directed by the Department.

   (2) A screw corporation stop (tap) shall be destroyed by removing a diagonal portion of the corporation stop thread. The corporation stop (tap) shall be closed, and the service pipe shall be disconnected. A driven corporation stop (tap) shall be removed and replaced with a screw plug, unless otherwise authorized by the Department.

   (3) All corporation stops (taps) and wet connections which are destroyed shall have the service pipes disconnected, the curb box (if any) removed, and a portion of the service pipe at the entry to the building removed.

   (4) When a corporation stop (tap) or wet connection has been shut off and the service pipe connected thereto is not to be used, the Licensed Master Plumber shall take the necessary steps to plug the corporation stop (tap), as outlined above.

   (5) Three-way connections to be abandoned shall have all piping disconnected and removed from the branch hub of the three-way, and an approved plug inserted into the hub. The plug shall be anchored to the main as directed by the Department. All work shall be done by a Licensed Master Plumber, and the permittee shall pay all costs associated with shutting the main. When a three-way hub is not available, the existing three-way outlet shall be capped and anchored to the main. All work shall be consistent with the Standard Water Main Specifications of the Department of Design and Construction (DDC).

(i) Use of tap location electrical indicator. When a building is to be demolished and the Tap Location Electrical Indicator Permit has been obtained, the Department will assist a Licensed Master Plumber in locating a tap through the use of an electrical indicator. If the indicator fails to locate the tap within five (5) feet of the expected location, the Licensed Master Plumber will be relieved of the obligation to plug and destroy the tap. No refund or credit of the permit fee will be granted if the indicator fails to locate the tap.

(j) Sizes of corporation stops (taps) and services pipes. The size of the corporation stop (tap) and service pipe to supply a premise shall be determined by the water demand load (gpm) of the premises, as determined by fixture units. In premises used for commercial and industrial purposes, where it is not feasible to determine the size of the tap and service pipe as indicated above, these sizes shall be determined solely by the water demand load (gpm) of the premises. (Tables for determining the appropriate sizes of taps and service pipes are found in Appendix Tables #1, #2 and #3.) The minimum tap shall be three quarter (3/4) inch, and the service pipe shall be at least one (1) inch in diameter. Unless otherwise approved by the Department, all taps shall be the same size as their corresponding service pipes and the goosenecks required by 15 RCNY § 20-03(n) shall be the same size as the service pipes.

(k) Fire connections and supply.

   (1) Fire connections. The Department of Buildings shall determine the size of all fire service pipes to be installed. The size of corporation stops (taps) or wet connections for fire service pipes shall be subject to the approval of the Department. All fire connection sizes shall be as follows:

      (i) The size of the corporation stop (tap) or wet connection for fire service pipes up to, and including, four (4) inches in diameter shall be the same size as the fire service pipe.

      (ii) For fire service pipes larger than four (4) inches in diameter, the size of the wet connection shall be one size smaller than the size of the fire service pipe.

   (2) Combined service pipes/dual fire and domestic service pipes. A connection for domestic purposes may be made from a fire service pipe only upon approval of the Department of Buildings. For such installations, valve(s) and meter(s) must be installed as required by 15 RCNY § 20-05.

   (3) Prohibitions. Fire service pipes shall not be cross-connected with any system of piping except as described in 15 RCNY § 20-02(1)(2).

(l) Appointments for tapping, wet connections, and inspections.

   (1) The Licensed Master Plumber shall provide the Department with advance notification of the requested corporation stop (tap) or wet connection installation date.

   (2) An inspection shall also be requested by the Licensed Master Plumber before backfill is placed on new or repaired service pipes.

   (3) The Department shall schedule corporation stop (tap) and wet connection installations during business hours, for the next available date.

(m) Rescheduling of corporation stop (tap), wet connection installation or service pipe inspection.

   (1) When a permittee fails to provide a safe and adequately sized excavation for installation of a corporation stop (tap) or wet connection on the date and time for which an appointment has been scheduled, the installation will not be made and the permittee will be required to schedule a new appointment.

   (2) When a permittee fails to have a completed service pipe installation or plug ready for inspection on the date and time for which an inspection has been scheduled, the permittee will be required to schedule a new appointment.

   (3) If a permittee must leave an excavation open for a subsequent corporation stop (tap)/wet connection installation or service pipe inspection, the excavation shall be made safe, in accordance with DOT requirements.

(n) Size of excavation. Sizes of excavations for wet connections and corporation stops (taps) shall be in accordance with the requirements of Appendix Table #4. If subsurface conditions prevent a plumber from making an excavation of the dimensions indicated therein, the plumber shall immediately notify the Department. The Department has the discretion to determine whether the dimensions should be changed, and what the new dimensions for the excavation shall be. All excavations shall be made safe by sheeting and bracing, where necessary, and shall conform with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.

(o) Driven corporation stops (taps). Where a drive corporation stop (tap) is uncovered, it must be maintained and protected. If a driven corporation stop (tap) is disturbed, it must be replaced with a screw corporation stop.

(p) Service pipe leak.

   (1) Upon discovery of a leaking service pipe, the Department will shut the corporation stop (tap) or wet connection unless it determines that there is no immediate threat to life or property. When there is no immediate threat to life or property, a Three-Day Notice to Repair will be served upon the owner or occupant of the premises. If the notice is not complied with, the Department will shut the corporation stop (tap) or wet connection.

(e) Compound, turbine, electromagnetic, and single-jet meters.

   (1) Meter Applications.

      (i) Effective May 1, 2014, compound or dual-register meters shall no longer be approved for use in new or replacement installations. The replacement of measuring elements in existing compound meters shall be permitted.

      (ii) Horizontal turbine meters shall be used wherever water is supplied to roof tanks by pumps or to buildings by other pumped, constant flow application, and may be used in buildings with booster pumps or pressurized supply systems as long as such systems' minimum non-zero flow rate is greater than the low-flow end of the 98.5% AWWA operating range for the specific meter model.

      (iii) Electromagnetic meters may be used in place of turbine meters where the flow rating of the pump does not exceed the high end of the published normal operating flow rate range for the electromagnetic meter.

      (iv) Single-jet, electromagnetic, or other meters designed for variable flow rates shall be used on services one-and-a-half (11/2) inch and larger in diameter and operating on street pressure, and may be used in buildings with booster pumps or pressurized system applications.

      (v) Single-jet meters shall be installed on a level horizontal plane +/- 10 degrees. Turbine, electromagnetic, and other meter types may be installed on an incline or vertical plane if a horizontal installation is not possible and the configuration is supported by the meter manufacturer's specifications. The meter register must always face outward for reading.

   (2) An approved flat plate or "Z" meter strainer shall be installed on all new or replacement turbine meter installations, unless the turbine meter is manufactured with an internal strainer. Such a strainer is not required for electromagnetic or single-jet meters, but its use is permitted.

   (3) [Repealed.]

   (4) [Repealed.]

(f) Used or repaired meters. No used or repaired meter shall be installed to cover a service pipe at the same or a different location unless it has been repaired, tested for accuracy, found to conform to AWWA new meter accuracy standards and has been approved by the Department.

(g) Sizing.

   (1) A meter shall be restricted to a size and type that will insure accurate registration on the basis of the water requirements of the premises, or portion of the premises, to be metered. For residential premises, the permit applicant shall perform a fixture count and develop a peak flow estimate using Appendix Tables #1 and #2. The meter shall be sized according to Appendix Table #8. For non-residential premises, the flow rate shall be based on the analysis of a Licensed Professional Engineer or Registered Architect. The meter shall be sized according to that flow rate and Appendix Table #8.

   (2) A meter shall not be larger than the service pipe supplying the meter, the piping in the meter setting, or the water distribution piping in the building, unless specifically approved in writing by the Department or as noted in 15 RCNY § 20-05(a)(5) for two-and-one-half (2 1/2) inch fire services or combined services. If two meters both cover the calculated peak flow rate, the smaller of the two meters shall be used unless approved in writing by the Department. Unless a fixture count and flow analysis, as described in 15 RCNY § 20-05(g)(1), has been approved by the Department, a one- or two-family home with gravity-flush water closets shall not have a meter on a domestic service without fire sprinklers larger than three-quarters (3/4)) inch and three-, four-, five- and six-family homes shall not have a meter on a domestic service larger than one (1) inch. Exceptions to these requirements, and the use of Appendix Table #8 for meter sizing, will be considered by the Department only when a building's plumbing system uses only street water pressure and documented incoming water pressure is less than 35 psi for buildings four (4) through six (6) stories high, or less than 30 psi for buildings less than four (4) stories in height.

   (3) The minimum size meter for new installations and replacements shall be five-eighths (5/8) inch.

   (4) The appropriate low-flow range for compound meters varies with the manufacturer. The ranges of sizes in Appendix Table #8 refer to the high-flow side. The Department may require that a permit applicant provide a basis for using a compound meter instead of another type of meter. That justification must outweigh the higher maintenance and other operating costs to the Department of the compound meter.

(h) Tests. The permit applicant shall submit the manufacturer's meter accuracy test results to the Department at the time of permit application. The Department retains the right, in specific instances, to require that a new, used or repaired meter be sent to a designated Department facility for testing at the owner's expense.

(i) Settings. Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary, all meters shall be set or reset according to the following requirements:

   (1) Meters shall be set as near as possible to the point of entry of the service pipe through the building or vault wall and shall be placed so that they may be easily inspected, maintained and replaced. Evaporative cooling tower meters or other meters used to calculate a wastewater allowance when located downstream of a billing meter shall be placed as close to the end use as practical. A property owner shall not erect or maintain any physical barrier that prevents access to, or repair or replacement of, the water meter.

      (i) Displacement meters shall not be set beyond three (3) feet of the entry point without written approval from the Department.

      (ii) Turbine and compound meters shall be set with straight sections of pipe as provided in Appendix Figures #7, #7A, #9, #9A, #10 and #10A. If pipe lengths cannot conform to those indicated in Appendix Figures #7, #7A, #9, #9A, #10 and #10A, a meter technology shall be used which does not require minimum straight pipe lengths. The Department shall identify such meter technologies in its list of approved meters. An approved meter strainer is required unless one is included in the meter design or in the case of single-jet or electromagnetic meters, is not required by the meter manufacturer.

   (2) No fittings capable of a branch connection shall be permitted in the section of pipe upstream of the meter or meter setter with the exception of an approved strainer. The strainer shall be located immediately before the inlet side of the meter. The service pipe between the point of entry and the meter setting shall be kept visible. No fittings, devices, or equipment shall be permitted in the section of pipe upstream or downstream of the meter that interferes with the required laminar flow through the meter.

   (3) If conditions exist that prevent the setting of a meter in accordance with the above requirements, the meter may be set outside the building in a meter pit, vault or above-ground meter box (See 15 RCNY § 20-05(k)).

   (4) Meter settings shall have an inlet valve immediately upstream of the meter and any strainer, and an outlet valve downstream of the meter. For meters two (2) inches in size or smaller, the valves shall be full-port ball valves. For meters larger than two (2) inches in size, the valves shall be rising stem, resilient seated, and epoxy-coated gate valves. If a backflow prevention device is located after the meter setting and both the backflow prevention device and meter setting are located on the same floor of a building, then an outlet valve serving both the backflow prevention device and meter setting may be placed immediately after the device. If the backflow prevention device and meter setting are located on different floors of a building, each set of equipment shall have its own outlet valve and test tee.

      (i) Except for meters two (2) inches or smaller where space constraints prevent any approved meter technology from being installed with an inlet valve, or as noted in 15 RCNY § 20-05(a)(5), a house control valve shall not be used in lieu of a meter inlet valve.

      (ii) A meter outlet valve is not required for fire meters on a dedicated fire service or the fire service branch of a combined service, for a Detector Check Valve Assembly or if the property has approved backflow prevention equipment which includes an outlet valve.

      (iii) A plain tip test tee shall be provided before the meter outlet valve or incorporated into the design of the meter outlet valve. For meters up to two (2) inches in diameter, the test tee shall be the same size as the meter. For meters larger than two (2) inches in diameter, the test tee shall be two (2) inches. An exception shall be provided for installations using an outlet valve that incorporates an one-and-a-half (1 1/2) inch rather than two (2) inch test tee into the design of its two (2) inch outlet valve. Factory-fabricated setters five-eights (5/8) inch through two (2) inches shall have test ports as described in paragraph 6 of this subdivision. Test port plugs on meter bodies shall be drilled for seal wire. Test tees are not to be used as connections for domestic service. Where a meter is placed in a pit alongside a sewer trap, the meter test tee shall be located outside of the pit in an accessible location.

   (5) Connections shall be made by coupling, union, flange union or approved compression fittings and bored for sealing with holes not less than three thirty-seconds (3/32) of an inch in diameter. Compression fittings are permitted for three quarter (3/4) inch through two (2) inch meters only. Unions, couplings or compression fittings that permit removal of the meter and/or setter without breaking the seal wire are prohibited. Grooved end mechanical pipe joining systems are not permitted between the meter inlet valve and the outlet side of the meter. If used on the service side of the house valve, such systems shall be drilled for seal wire. In all other circumstances, pipe joining specifications shall conform to the New York City Plumbing Code. All water meter settings of two (2) inches and smaller sizes shall utilize valves and fittings constructed of bronze with a lead content that shall not exceed current NSF/ANSI Standard 61 limits. Bolts, studs, nuts, screws and other external fastening devices shall be made of a bronze alloy or stainless steel conforming to AWWA standards, and shall be designed for easy removal following lengthy service.

Chapter 28: Citywide Construction Noise Mitigation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 28-100 General Construction Noise Mitigation Plan.*


In accordance with § 24-219 and § 24-220 of the New York City Noise Control Code, every construction site where construction activities take place shall have, conspicuously posted and filed with the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), a complete and accurate Construction Noise Mitigation Plan, except such sites that will have emergency work completed within three days or less, shall not be required to file the plan. An after hours variance, pursuant to § 24-223 of the Noise Control Code may be applied for if work is not possible during otherwise allowable hours. Such plan must be readily available for inspection at the construction site. The Construction Noise Mitigation Plan Form is available at: http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/noise/construction-noise.shtml.








*§ 28-101 Required Noise Mitigation Measures for General Construction.*


a. The responsible party shall self-certify in its Construction Noise Mitigation Plan that all construction tools and equipment have been maintained so that they operate at normal manufacturer's operating specifications, including at peak loading. Such self-certification shall be indicated on the Construction Noise Mitigation Plan form required by 15 RCNY § 28-100. Upon a DEP inspection of the work site, DEP shall use the noise level guidelines in the Federal Highway Administration Roadway Construction Noise Model User's Guide, Jan. 2006, page 3, located in the Appendix to this chapter, as a means of identifying equipment that may be the cause of a noise complaint. If an individual piece of equipment is identified by DEP as exceeding the level specified in such Guide located in the Appendix to this chapter, upon notification by DEP, the responsible party shall have the option of: (i) performing maintenance to demonstrate a good faith effort, notwithstanding the model year of the equipment, to mitigate the noise by a measurable level acceptable to the Department, (ii) replacing the equipment with equipment that complies with said level, or (iii) filing an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan pursuant to 15 RCNY § 28-104, within five business days of said inspection. If the responsible party elects to perform maintenance pursuant to option (i), but cannot demonstrate within five business days a reduction in noise by a measurable level acceptable to the Department, such party shall pursue one of the other two options to the satisfaction of the Department. The failure to exercise and complete one of such three options within five business days of said inspection shall be a violation of this rule.

b. All construction equipment being operated on site must be equipped with the appropriate manufacturer's noise reduction device(s), including, but not limited to, a manufacturer's muffler (or equivalently rated material) that is free of rust, holes and exhaust leaks.

c. The responsible party shall mitigate noise from construction devices with internal combustion engines by ensuring that the engine's housing doors are kept closed, and by using noise-insulating material mounted on the engine housing that does not interfere with the manufacturer's guidelines for engine operation or exhaust. The responsible party shall further reduce noise by operating the device at lower engine speeds during the work to the maximum extent possible.

d. Portable compressors, generators, pumps and other such devices shall be covered with noise-insulating fabric to the maximum extent possible that does not interfere with the manufacturer's guidelines for engine operation or exhaust, and shall further reduce noise by operating the device at lower engine speeds during the work to the maximum extent possible.

e. Vehicle engine idling on site shall be prevented in accordance with New York City Administrative Code § 24-163.

f. Quieter back-up alarms shall be used in pre-2008 model year vehicles when practicable for the job site. 2008 model year or newer vehicles shall be equipped with a quieter back-up warning device in accordance with OSHA standards, as set forth in paragraph 4 of subdivision d of 15 RCNY § 28-102.

g. When DOB regulations require a perimeter barrier, or "construction fence," and the site is within 200 feet of a receptor or a receiving property as defined in 15 RCNY § 28-109, perimeter noise barriers shall be fabricated in accordance with the standards set forth in subdivision e of 15 RCNY § 28-107 and lined with material set forth in subdivisions c and e of 15 RCNY § 28-107. Further, the responsible party shall fill in any gaps and holes in adjacent panels of noise barriers with noise attenuation material, so as to maximize the effectiveness of such barriers. Such noise attenuation material shall include noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material. When viewing ports are required in the curtain material, they shall be filled in with clear plastic attached to the curtain.

h. The contractor shall create and utilize a noise mitigation training program, which shall be implemented for all field-worker supervisory personnel including sub-contractor supervisors. Supervisory personnel shall field-train all field workers to minimize construction noise. Such training program shall be developed in consultation with DEP.

i. When work is planned near sensitive receptors, including but not limited to facilities such as schools, hospitals, places of worship, and homes for the aging, the responsible party shall cooperate with the facility owner or operator to coordinate the work schedule so as to minimize the noise impact on the facility.

j. A DEP inspector may visit a construction site to examine the Noise Mitigation Plan upon receiving a complaint, or as a matter of routine inspection, to ensure that the responsible party is complying with such Plan. A responsible party found not to be complying with such Plan shall be provided a cure period of three business days to correct the condition or to file an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan under 15 RCNY § 28-104. If the condition is not corrected nor an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan filed with DEP within three business days, then a Notice of Violation shall be issued against the responsible party. Said violations may be issued on-site or by mail. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences in this subdivision, there shall be no cure period afforded with respect to compliance with 15 RCNY §§ 28-100; 28-101(a), (b), (e), (f), (h); 28-104; 28-105; and 28-106(a), (b), (d) (g) &amp; (i).

k. Construction activities may take place during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays. At all other times, the permitee shall obtain after-hours authorization, pursuant to 15 RCNY § 28-103.

l. Where construction projects are of shorter duration of less than 15 days and within the property line and do not require Department of Buildings (DOB) perimeter barriers ("construction fences"), and where the work site is within 75 feet of a residential receptor, a temporary or portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier shall be fabricated in accordance with the specifications in 15 RCNY § 28-108. For long-term street work, defined as 15 days or longer, that is outside the property line and within 75 feet of a residential receptor and where there is a dedicated lane available, a temporary barrier in accordance with the specifications in 15 RCNY § 28-108 shall be required.

m. Whenever a responsible party is engaged in sandblasting operations that require a perimeter or other barrier during sandblasting, said barrier shall be lined with noise barrier material as set forth in subdivision e of 15 RCNY § 28-107.

n. Responsible parties conducting construction and roadway work that will commence and be completed within a continuous period of no longer than 24 hours or for emergency work that will last no longer than three consecutive days, need not file with DEP a Construction Noise Mitigation Plan. However, the responsible party for such construction work shall not create unreasonable noise. In addition, if the work occurs near or adjacent to a sensitive receptor as defined in 15 RCNY § 28-101(i), then the responsible party shall make modifications including scheduling changes or employing additional noise mitigation methods listed in 15 RCNY §§ 28-102, 28-107, and 28-108. This subdivision shall not apply to construction work that occurs after hours.

o. Technical terms in these rules are defined in the Noise Code or in 15 RCNY § 28-109.








*§ 28-102 Construction Devices and Activities.*


The devices listed in this section require additional noise mitigation. A responsible party using any of these devices shall mitigate the noise by following the rules set forth in this section for the specific device. There are five categories of devices:

a. Impact Equipment: Pile Drivers, Jackhammers, Hoe Rams, Blasting.b. Earth Moving Devices: Vacuum Excavators.c. Construction Trucks: Dump Trucks.d. Stationary Devices: Cranes, Auger Drills, Street Plates, Backup Alarms.e. Manual Devices: Concrete Saws. If the responsible party cannot in good faith comply with the noise mitigation rules for each device, the responsible party shall file with DEP an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan in accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-104.

a. Impact Equipment.

   1. Pile Drivers. This rule provides noise mitigation strategies that responsible parties shall utilize in order to reduce the noise emissions from pile driving and related equipment. Pile drivers for sheet piles and/or column piles are a common necessity on a construction project. Piles can be used to stabilize trench walls during excavation, create coffer dams to hold back water, or to provide an anchored platform upon which structures can be built. There are two basic types of pile drivers – impact hammers and vibratory drivers. Noise emission levels from pile drivers can vary widely based on the type of driver, the type of pile (steel, concrete, wood), and the underlying ground conditions.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MODELS &amp; MUFFLERS

         i. The quietest pile driving method shall be selected that allows the work to be performed based on structural, geotechnical, and pile friction requirements and ground conditions. The following list or their equivalent are acceptable pile-driving methods to the Department: a hydraulic pile pushing system, a vibratory pile driver; a hydraulic impact pile driver; a drop hammer, a diesel impact pile driver.

         ii. Hydraulic pushing method pile drivers, including the Ken-Jet Still Worker, the Giken Silent Piler, or the SERF Pilemaster, or equivalent, shall be utilized rather than louder impact or vibratory pile drivers when ground conditions permit such use. Further, such quieter pile drivers shall be utilized whenever a responsible party is working within 100 feet of a receptor.

         iii. In accordance with the noise mitigation criteria outlined in 15 RCNY § 28-101(b), an impact pile driver shall be equipped with a well maintained exhaust muffler in order to mitigate the amount of noise escaping out with the diesel exhaust.

         iv. The responsible party shall select the type of pile being driven based on structural and/or geotechnical performance requirements. In order of loudness, wooden piles shall be preferred first, followed by concrete piles, and then steel piles.

         v. The responsible party shall pre-auger or pre-trench the pile holes to soften the underlying ground, reduce ground resistance, and thus reduce pile driving noise based upon geotechnical conditions at the location. Auger drill rigs may be mounted to the same crane as the pile driver or alternatively, an excavator with a long bucket arm may pre-trench as deep as 25 feet below grade.

         vi. A properly secured impact cushion shall be installed on top of piles that are being driven by an impact hammer. Commercially available pile cushions or those fabricated on the job site, out of scrap wood, leather or rubber, may be utilized.

         vii. Quieter alternative methods to pile driving, including the use of drilled caissons filled with concrete, or slurry walls dug out initially with a milling machine, shall be used whenever possible, depending on structural and geotechnical performance requirements.

         viii. Noise bellows systems such as the IHC Hydrohammer, or an equivalent bellows device, may be used to provide further noise attenuation. Bellows enclosures accompany the pile down to the ground and collapse accordion style as the pile reaches the ground.

         ix. When the responsible party uses a vibratory pile driver or a hydraulic impact pile driver as set forth in clause (ii) of this subparagraph and/or noise bellows as set forth in clause (viii) of this subparagraph, between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, the responsible party need not utilize additional pathway controls listed in subparagraph C of this paragraph, unless the responsible party is performing work within 35 feet of an indoor receptor and with the exception of any required perimeter barriers as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

         x. No violation shall be issued to the responsible party if the bellows in clause (viii) of this subparagraph B or the barriers listed in subparagraph C of this paragraph are adjusted such that the operator can view the end of the hammer for safety purposes.

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; ENCLOSURES. The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls. However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP.

         i. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes and constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater. It shall be positioned as close as possible to the pile driver. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier can be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels shall be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent panels shall be filled-in with noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material when practicable. A properly balanced canted panel, not susceptible to windy conditions, may be placed on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors. However, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         ii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the pile driver and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier should be placed as close to the actual pile driving work as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

         iii. Where applicable, portable noise shields made of steel frames wrapped with noise curtain material, such as SoundSeal model BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, shall be hoisted up into position on the crane's second cable to form a noise barrier in the direction of sensitive receptors. The shield shall be large enough to completely block the line of sight between the receptors and the pile driver, and shall be lowered to the ground as the pile is being driven in order to maintain the shielding effect. Such portable noise shield shall be utilized when the pile driver is higher than any barrier at the site required under 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

         iv. Alternative barriers may be utilized in accordance with site-specific conditions. For example, shipping container (Conex) boxes or truck trailers may be positioned along the edge of the work site to form an effective semi-permanent noise barrier. Sufficient space at the site is necessary, as these containers are generally 8 feet wide by 8 feet tall and can be double-stacked to form a noise barrier 16 feet in height. The gaps between and/or under container boxes shall be filled-in with heavy vinyl noise curtains or similar materials. It should be noted that gaps and spaces are one of the primary contributors to degrading a noise barrier's performance.

   2. Jackhammers/Pavement Breakers. This rule shall provide noise mitigation strategies that the responsible party shall utilize in order to reduce the noise emissions from jackhammers and pavement breakers. These devices are defined as manually-operated, powered (pneumatic or other) devices, consisting of chisel-hammers or bits used to cut or break through pavement, concrete, or street surfaces. Jackhammers can be very loud as the steel chisel or bit hits the target object.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MODELS &amp; MUFFLERS

         i. Quieter makes and models of jackhammers such as the Copco model TEX P90S or equivalent model with an elongated effective muffler casing or bellows measuring a total of greater than 15 inches in length, shall be used whenever practicable.

         ii. The quietest jackhammer suitable to perform the given work shall be selected for use. The quieter jackhammers, including the jackhammer specified in clause (i) of this subparagraph or the Chicago Pneumatic CP1240, with a model F-814004 muffler, or equivalent, shall be used when suitable and whenever a responsible party is working in close proximity to receptors, whenever a responsible party is using multiple jackhammers, and whenever jackhammer operations are occurring during after hours as set forth in § 24-223 of the Administrative Code.

         iii. In all cases, jackhammers shall be equipped with an effective muffler, provided either from the manufacturer or from an aftermarket vendor, which effectively reduces noise from the exhaust air by about 4 dBA or more. In accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-101(b), an effective muffler shall be properly fitted to the jackhammer to insure against air or noise leakage.

         iv. If appropriate to the size of the job, smaller jackhammers shall be used, as they tend to be quieter.

         v. When the responsible party uses a device described in clause (i) of this subparagraph between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, the responsible party need not utilize additional pathway controls listed in subparagraph C of this paragraph, unless the responsible party is performing work within 35 feet of an indoor receptor and with the exception of any required perimeter barriers as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; ENCLOSURES. The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls for jackhammers or pavement breaker operations within a property line or for long-term work when outside of the property line as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-101(l). However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP. The pathway controls are set forth as follows: jersey barriers, tents, or other portable noise barriers.

         i. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes and constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater and that shall be positioned as close as possible to the jack hammer. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the jackhammer and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier shall be placed as close to the actual jackhammering work as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source. A balanced canted panel, not susceptible to high winds shall be placed, when feasible, on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors. However, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         ii. Jersey barriers. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier can be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels can be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent panels should be filled-in with noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material. All jersey barriers shall comply with the requirements in clause (i) of this subparagraph, including a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater.

         iii. Portable noise enclosures.

            (a) Portable noise enclosures (so-called "noise tents") made of steel frames wrapped with noise curtain material, such as SoundSeal model BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, may be built to surround the jackhammer (on the top and 3 sides) and the operator. A properly constructed enclosure, using curtain material with a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater, generally provides a 5 dBA insertion loss. Such barrier shall meet OSHA standards for worker exposure to particulate matter.

            (b) The responsible party shall utilize multiple tents for multiple jackhammers. For example, when two jackhammers are being utilized and they cannot fit under the same noise tent, the responsible party shall provide an additional noise tent.

            (c) The noise tent shall be moved as the jackhammer work progresses in order to maintain the tent's ability to block the line of sight between the jackhammer and the receptors.

            (d) In accordance with § 24-223 of the Administrative Code, when emergency jackhammering occurs after normal working hours within 500 feet of any residential receptor, the responsible party shall use noise tents with double thick noise curtain material or a noise tent augmented with a portable noise barrier to form a double layer of mitigation. See 15 RCNY § 28-108. Quieter jackhammers and compressor vehicles shall also be utilized during after hours work whenever feasible.

            (e) Where there are receptors surrounding the jackhammer work site on all sides, two tents shall be used on either side of the jackhammer to form a complete enclosure as close to the jackhammer as practicable.

   3. Hoe Rams. This rule shall provide noise mitigation strategies that the responsible party shall utilize in order to reduce the noise emissions from hoe rams. Hoe rams, and hoe ram-like devices, are used to cut through roadway pavement or concrete walls and for demolition of large concrete or steel structures. They are typically large hydraulic chisel-hammers attached on the end of a backhoe or excavator arm that can be very loud as the steel chisel hits the target object.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MODELS &amp; MUFFLERS

         i. Quieter makes and models of hoe rams, such as the Bosma Hammer-Head or equivalent quieter devices, shall be used whenever feasible, especially near receptors.

         ii. The smallest hoe ram necessary shall be selected to perform the task, as smaller devices tend to produce less noise.

         iii. A noise shroud enclosure shall be wrapped around the head (i.e. chisel) of the hoe ram whenever working within 200 feet of a receptor. Shrouds may be selected from various manufacturers such as Krupp Industries, Allied Hi-Ram, Montabert, or Rammer Inc. with steel shrouds to attach to the hoe ram head. Alternatively, a shroud may be fabricated on-site by wrapping the chisel head with a heavy vinyl noise curtain material, such as SoundSeal BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, and securing it with tie wire.

         iv. A skilled hoe ram operator can significantly affect the amount of noise produced during the work. In accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-101(h), responsible party and sub-contractor personnel shall be trained on the proper angle or position when the hoe ram chisel is placed against the work. The operator shall position and operate the device in such a manner as to minimize its noise output. A violation shall only be issued for failure to train the operator as set forth in subdivision (h) of 15 RCNY § 28-101.

         v. Alternative methods to hoe ramming concrete, including hydraulic jacks or chemical splitting (use of expansive demolition agents), shall be utilized whenever feasible. For steel demolition, alternative quieter methods may include the use of hydraulic shears and grapples, or the use of torches to cut the steel into more manageable pieces, which can then be trucked off-site for further demolition.

         vi. When the responsible party uses specific makes and models as set forth in clause (i) of this subparagraph or a noise shroud as set forth in clause (iii) of this subparagraph, between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, then the responsible party need not utilize additional pathway controls listed in subparagraph C of this paragraph, unless the responsible party is performing work within 35 feet of an indoor receptor and with the exception of any required perimeter barriers as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

         vii. No violation shall be issued to the responsible party if any of the shrouds in clause (iii) of this subparagraph are adjusted such that the operator can view the end of the bit for safety purposes.

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; ENCLOSURES. The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls below. However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP.

         i. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes and constructed of sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater and shall be positioned as close as possible to the hoe ram. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier can be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to a overall height of 15 feet. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels can be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent panels should be filled-in with noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material. A balanced canted panel, not susceptible to high winds shall be placed, when feasible, on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors. However, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         ii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the hoe ram and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier should be placed as close to the actual hoe ram work as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

         iii. Alternative barriers may be utilized in accordance with site-specific conditions. For example, shipping container (Conex) boxes or truck trailers may be positioned along the edge of the work site to form a semi-permanent noise barrier. Sufficient space must be available since containers are generally 8 feet wide by 8 feet tall and can be double-stacked to form a noise barrier 16 feet in height. The gaps between and/or under container boxes should be filled-in with heavy vinyl noise curtains or similar material.

         iv. Where there are receptors surrounding the hoe ram work site on all sides, several noise barriers shall be used to form a complete enclosure around the hoe ram.

   4. Blasting. This rule shall provide noise mitigation strategies that the responsible party shall utilize in order to reduce the noise emissions from blasting. The controlled use of explosives is occasionally necessary on a construction site, primarily to loosen hard rock ledges or to demolish large concrete structures. This rule does not apply to tunneling activities subject to the regulations set forth in § 24-246 of the Administrative Code.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

         ii. The necessary and FDNY-regulated use of blasting shall be done in close coordination with the affected public in order to minimize potential disturbance.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS:

         i. The smallest appropriate blasting charge possible shall be used in order to minimize blasting noise at its source. The quietest explosive material possible shall also be selected. Relatively slow-burning explosives produce quieter noise emissions as compared to faster-burning explosives.

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: BLAST MATS AND BARRIERS

         i. Blast mats made of heavy rubber shall be laid over the blast site.

         ii. When blasting occurs close to receptors, the responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes, constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater, and positioned as close as possible to the blast site.

         iii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the blasting and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier can be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to a maximum height of 15 feet.

b. Earth Moving Equipment.

   1. Vacuum Excavators. This rule shall provide noise mitigation strategies the responsible party shall utilize when working with a vacuum excavator, or vac-truck. A vac-truck is a vehicle equipped with a low pressure suction hose leading to an on-board storage tank. Vac-trucks are generally used when removing dirt to avoid disrupting underground utility services such as telecommunications cables, water and sewer pipes, gas lines, or electrical cables.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MODELS &amp; SILENCERS

         i. Smaller capacity (lower suction) vac-trucks tend to be quieter and shall be used whenever practicable. Listed from the quietest to the loudest order, examples include GapVac, BSI Dewitz, BoVac and Guzzler.

         ii. Vac-trucks shall be run in their lower power setting whenever practicable. While suction capacity is reduced with lower engine speeds, there remains adequate suction to perform almost any job.

         iii. Several manufacturers do provide silencers on the air intake and exhaust sides of the blower. Heavier duty silencers including Universal, Industrial Acoustics, McGill and Burgess-Manning, or equivalent, shall be used whenever practicable.

         iv. The vac-truck's suction creating component (i.e. blower) shall be covered with a noise-reducing housing or enclosure.

         v. When the responsible party uses a specific vac-truck as set forth in clause (i) of this subparagraph and/or silencers specifically set forth in clause (iii) of this subparagraph between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, then the responsible party need not utilize additional pathway controls listed in subparagraph C of this paragraph, unless the responsible party is performing work within 35 feet of an indoor receptor and with the exception of any required perimeter barriers as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; CURTAINS. The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls below. However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP.

         i. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free of gaps and holes and constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30, or greater, and shall be positioned as close as possible to the vac-truck. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier can be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels shall be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent panels should be filled-in with noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material. A properly balanced canted panel, not susceptible to windy conditions, may be placed on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors. However, such barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         ii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the vac-truck and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier should be placed as close to the actual vac-truck work as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

         iii. Portable noise shields made of steel frames wrapped with noise curtain material, such as SoundSeal model BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, shall be used to form a noise barrier in the direction of sensitive receptors and completely block the line of sight between the receptors and vac-truck. Noise curtains are typically made out of a 1/4-inch thick heavy vinyl material, often with a noise absorptive quilt attached to one side. These noise curtains generally weigh 1.5 lbs/sq. ft., have an STC rating of about 32, and come in 4-foot wide sheets complete with grommets and Velcro edges to aid in hanging the curtains and sealing the sheets side-by-side.

         iv. Alternative barriers may be utilized in accordance with site-specific conditions. For example, shipping container (Conex) boxes or truck trailers can be positioned along the edge of the work site to form a semi-permanent noise barrier. Sufficient space at the site is necessary as these containers are typically 8 feet wide by 8 feet tall and can be double-stacked to form a noise barrier 16 feet in height. The gaps between and/or under container boxes should be filled-in with heavy vinyl noise curtains or similar materials.

         v. Whenever possible, vac-truck exhaust shall be positioned and directed away from receptors.

c. Construction Trucks and Vehicles.

   1. Dump Trucks. This paragraph shall provide noise mitigation strategies that the responsible party shall utilize in order to reduce the noise emissions from dump trucks. Dump trucks are commonly used on construction sites in order to deliver construction materials, remove and excavate debris, or transfer materials around the job site. However they can produce loud noises when their tailgates are slammed when dumping a load, when their engines are revved with inadequate exhaust mufflers, when the first shovel-full is dropped into the bed, or due to use of their backup alarms.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS

         i. The smallest sized and quietest dump truck that is adequate for a particular job shall be selected.

         ii. A bed liner made of thick rubber, spray-on liner, plywood, sand or gravel shall be installed to mitigate the noise of the first load being dropped into the dump truck.

         iii. Though not required for use in the United States (U.S.), most U.S. dump truck manufacturers produce quieter models for use in Europe. European Environmental Label (i.e. Blue Angel) low noise emission construction equipment, which is required for import and use in European Union (EU) nations in accordance with Quality Assurance Publication RAL UZ 53 and the Treaty on European Union 992-02-07 Journal C224, shall be used whenever feasible if it meets the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's emission requirements and/or regulations. These models are generally 10 dBA quieter than similar equipment used in the U.S.

         iv. The positioning of the dump truck shall be carefully selected in order to minimize operation near receptors. Responsible parties shall attempt to reduce the necessity of backing-up by selecting a straight drive-through truck route. If a backup alarm is used, a quieter warning device shall be installed in accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-101(f).

         v. The truck shall be equipped with an effective muffler in accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-101(b), which shall be well-maintained to ensure maximum noise reduction.

         vi. Slamming a tail gate shall be avoided to the extent possible to prevent unreasonable noise. Alternately, a pad made of heavy rubber, leather or wood, when practicable, shall be used under the tail gate to prevent metal contact.

         vii. The engine housing doors shall be kept closed while the engine is in operation.

         viii. When the responsible party uses quieter dump truck models as set forth in clause (iii) of this subparagraph, between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, the responsible party need not utilize additional pathway controls listed in subparagraph C of this paragraph, unless the responsible party is performing work within 35 feet of an indoor receptor and with the exception of any required perimeter barriers as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; CURTAINS The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls. However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP.

         i. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes and constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30, and shall be positioned as close as possible to the vehicle, in order to provide the greatest insertion loss. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier can be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels may be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent panels shall be filled-in with noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material. A canted panel may be placed on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors; however care must be taken to avoid having the barrier tip over from unbalanced loading. Further, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         ii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the dump truck and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier shall be placed as close to the actual dump truck work as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

         iii. Noise curtain material, such as SoundSeal model BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, shall be used to form a noise barrier in the direction of sensitive receptors and completely block the line of sight between the receptors and dump truck. It shall also be draped over the dump truck to augment the engine housing and exhaust stack. Noise curtains are typically made out of a 1/4-inch thick heavy vinyl material, often with a noise absorptive quilt attached to one side. These noise curtains generally weigh 1.5 lbs/sq. ft., have an STC rating of about 32, and come in 4-foot wide sheets complete with grommets and Velcro edges to aid in hanging the curtains and sealing the sheets side-by-side.

         iv. Conveyor belts shall be used whenever practicable, as they may allow the dump trucks to operate much farther away from receptors.

         v. Alternative barriers may be utilized in accordance with site-specific conditions. For example, shipping container (Conex) boxes or truck trailers may be positioned along the edge of the work site to form a semi-permanent noise barrier. Sufficient space at the site is necessary as these containers are generally 8 feet wide by 8 feet tall and can be double-stacked to form a noise barrier 16 feet in height. The gaps between and/or under container boxes shall be filled-in with heavy vinyl noise curtains or similar material.

d. Stationary Equipment.

   1. Cranes. This rule shall provide noise mitigation strategies that the responsible party shall utilize in order to reduce the noise emissions from cranes. Cranes are an essential piece of equipment on most large construction sites in order to load and unload delivery trucks, lift building materials to required heights, lift excavated materials out of tunnels and for other sub-surface excavations, and move other equipment and personnel around the job site. Cranes come in many varieties and sizes, including tracked or wheeled mobile cranes, fixed or floating derricks, and tower cranes.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MODELS

         i. There are various makes and models that are inherently quieter than others. Smaller, quieter cranes, including rubber-tired mobile cranes, shall be used whenever possible based on load lifting requirements.

         ii. New modern hydraulic cranes shall be used whenever possible to avoid the squeal produced by cable drum brakes on mechanical cranes.

         iii. Though not required for use in the United States, most U.S. crane manufacturers produce quieter models for use in Europe. European Environmental Label (i.e. Blue Angel) low noise emission construction equipment, which is required for import and use in European Union (EU) nations in accordance with Quality Assurance Publication RAL UZ 53 and the Treaty on European Union 992-02-07 Journal C224, shall be used whenever feasible and if it meets the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's emission requirements and/or regulations. These cranes are about 10 dBA quieter than similar models sold in the U.S.

         iv. The positioning of the crane shall be carefully selected in order to minimize the need to relocate it around the job site. Whenever possible, tower cranes shall be used, as they essentially produce no noise at ground level.

         v. The crane shall be equipped with an effective muffler in accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-101(b), which shall be well maintained to ensure maximum noise reduction.

         vi. When the responsible party uses new modern hydraulic cranes as set forth in clause (ii) of this subparagraph and/or additional source controls set forth in clause (iii) of this subparagraph, between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, the responsible party need not utilize additional pathway controls listed in subparagraph C of this paragraph, unless the responsible party is performing work within 35 feet of an indoor receptor and with the exception of any required perimeter barriers as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; CURTAINS The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls.

The gaps between and/or under container boxes shall be filled-in with heavy vinyl noise curtains or similar material.

   2. Auger Drill Rigs. This rule shall provide mitigation strategies the responsible party shall utilize when using auger drill rigs. Auger drill rigs are typically mounted to cranes or they can be built as dedicated machines as well. Auger drill rigs are used to drill shafts into the ground, which are then filled with cement form concrete piles, to loosen underlying soil and allow solid piles to be driven more easily, or used in multiple configuration to "mix" grout into the soil and change the soil's properties (i.e. strengthen it and reduce its water content).

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MODELS &amp; SILENCERS

         i. The auger drill rig or crane shall be equipped with an effective muffler in accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-101(b), which shall be well- maintained to ensure maximum noise reduction.

         ii. All moving parts shall be well lubricated for proper drilling performance and to avoid unnecessary noise from squeaking parts.

         iii. Debris on the drill bit shall be removed without quick twisting, jerking or hammering the bit, unless geotechnical conditions at the location so require. Alternative quieter methods include use of a high pressure water hose where debris is not contaminated or a laborer using a hand shovel.

      C. PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; CURTAINS The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls. However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP.

         i. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes and constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30, or greater, and shall be positioned as close as possible to the auger drill rig. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier may be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet.

The gaps between adjacent panels shall be filled-in with noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material. A properly balanced canted panel, not susceptible to windy conditions, may be placed on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors. However, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         ii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the auger drill rig and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier should be placed as close to the actual auger drill rig work as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

         iii. Noise curtain material, such as SoundSeal model BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, shall be used to form a noise barrier in the direction of sensitive receptors and completely block the line of sight between the receptors and auger drill rig. Noise curtains are typically made out of a 1/4-inch thick heavy vinyl material, often with a noise absorptive quilt attached to one side. These noise curtains generally weigh 1.5 lbs/sq. ft., have an STC rating of about 32, and come in 4-foot wide sheets complete with grommets and Velcro edges to aid in hanging the curtains and sealing the sheets side-by-side.

         iv. Alternative barriers may be utilized in accordance with site-specific conditions. For example, shipping container (Conex) boxes or truck trailers may be positioned along the edge of the work site to form a semi-permanent noise barrier. Sufficient space at the site is necessary as these containers are generally 8 feet wide by 8 feet tall and can be double-stacked to form a noise barrier 16 feet in height. The gaps between and/or under container boxes shall be filled-in with heavy vinyl noise curtains or similar material.

   3. Street Plates. In addition to the Department of Transportation rules set forth in 34 RCNY § 2-11(10), the responsible party shall follow one or more of the following methods to reduce noise emissions from loose or rattling street plates.

      A. SOURCE CONTROLS:

         i. The street plates shall be installed in the street surface in accordance with 34 RCNY § 2-11(10) in order to have a level and smooth transition from pavement to plate surface and to keep the plates firmly in place.

         ii. Asphalt cold-patch shall be applied when feasible around the edges of the street plate to minimize vehicular tire impact on the plate and to help keep the plate in place.

      B. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS:

         i. Whenever feasible, traffic shall be routed around the street plates by placing traffic cones, barrels, and/or warning tape around the plated area.

   4. Backup Alarms. In accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-101(f), all existing vehicles that enter a work site shall be equipped with OSHA-approved, and OEM manufacturer-approved (if necessary), quieter backup alarms by January 1, 2008. All new vehicles that enter the work site shall be equipped with OSHA-approved quieter backup alarms by January 1, 2008. All on-road vehicles that do not enter the work site, but are in operation after hours pursuant to 15 RCNY § 28-103, shall also be equipped with OSHA-approved, and OEM manufacturer-approved (if necessary), quieter backup alarms by January 1, 2008. The work site referenced in this paragraph shall mean construction sites within the property line. Subparagraph A of this paragraph contains a list of quieter OSHA-approved backup alarms pursuant to OSHA Regulations, 29 C.F.R. Part 1926, Subpart "O", 1926.601.b.4 and 1926.602.a.9. If the responsible party cannot reasonably comply with the requirements of this paragraph, such person shall file an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan in accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-104.

      A. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MAKES &amp; MODELS

         i. Quieter alarms or similar backup devices that meet OSHA requirements may be selected from the list below or from equivalent quieter alarms.

            (a) Examples of manually-adjustable backup alarms include:

               •     Preco Model 45AA

               •     Ecco Model 820

            (b) Examples of automatically-adjustable backup alarms include:

               •     Preco Model 1048

               •     Ecco Model SA907

               •     Grote Model 73100

            (c) Examples of community sensitive backup alarms include:

               •     BBS-TEK Brigade Model BBS-92

         ii. When the responsible party uses quieter backup alarms as described in clause (i) of this subparagraph, the responsible party need not utilize additional pathway controls listed in subparagraph B of this paragraph, unless the responsible party is performing work within 35 feet of an indoor receptor and with the exception of any required perimeter barriers as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

      B. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS. If it is not feasible to select one of the OSHA-approved alarms in subparagraph A of this paragraph, responsible parties shall utilize one of the following pathway controls. However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP.

         i. Responsible parties shall attempt to reduce the necessity of backing-up by selecting a straight drive-through truck route.

         ii. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes and constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater. It shall be positioned as close as possible to the vehicle, in order to provide the greatest insertion loss. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier may be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels may be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent panels shall be filled-in with noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material. A canted panel may also be built on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors; however care must be taken to avoid having the barrier tip over from unbalanced loading. Further, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         iii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the backup alarm and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier should be placed as close to the actual backup alarm as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

         iv. Alternative barriers may be utilized in accordance with site specification. Conex containers are likely already available to the responsible party. For example, where sufficient work site space exists, container (Conex) boxes or truck trailers may be positioned along the edge of the work site to form a semi-permanent noise barrier. These containers are typically 8 feet wide by 8 feet tall and can be double-stacked to form a noise barrier 16 feet in height. The gaps between and/or under container boxes shall be filled-in with heavy vinyl noise curtains or similar material.

e. Manually Operated Equipment.

   1. Concrete Saws. This rule shall provide noise mitigation strategies that the responsible party shall utilize in order to reduce the noise emissions from concrete saws. Concrete saws are used on construction projects primarily for demolition purposes, but can also be used for opening access holes, cutting stress relief channels, and finishing off new construction.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MODELS

         i. Smaller saws shall be used, based on the power and cutting depth necessary to perform the job, as they tend to be quieter.

         ii. A quieter-type saw blade, including a grinding saw blade or one made of ceramic or special-tipped cutting teeth, shall be chosen whenever practicable.

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; ENCLOSURES. The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls. However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP.

         i. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes and constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater, and is positioned as close as possible to the saw. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier may be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels shall be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent panels shall be filled-in with noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material. A properly balanced canted panel, not susceptible to windy conditions, may be placed on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors. However, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         ii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the saw and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier shall be placed as close to the actual saw work as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

         iii. Portable noise enclosures made of steel frames wrapped with noise curtain material, such as SoundSeal model BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, shall be built to surround (top and 3 sides) the concrete saw and the operator. A well made enclosure, using curtain material with a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater, can generally provide a 5 dBA insertion loss providing there are no gaps in the enclosure. Noise tents may be reused at other sites with proper care and maintenance.

         iv. There shall be multiple tents for multiple concrete saws. For example, when two saws are being utilized and they cannot fit under the same noise tent, the responsible party shall provide an additional noise tent.

         v. The noise tent shall be moved as the concrete saw work progresses in order to maintain the tent's ability to block the line-of-sight between the saw and the receptors.

         vi. Emergency concrete sawing that occurs on any public right-of-way after normal working hours as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103, within 500 feet of any residential receptor, shall require noise tents with double-thick noise curtain material, or a noise tent augmented with a portable noise barrier to form a double layer of mitigation.

         vii. Where there are receptors surrounding the concrete saw work site on all sides, two tents shall be used whenever practicable, on either side of the saw, to form a complete enclosure.








*§ 28-103 Authorized Work Hours.*


a. Equipment shall be used only during the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, unless the responsible party obtains an after hours work authorization, in which case the equipment shall be used in accordance with the hours specified in the permit and in the after hours work authorization, as set forth in § 24-223 of the Administrative Code.

b. When work occurs after hours in accordance with § 24-223 of the Administrative Code, or falls within one of the exceptions to limits on after hours and weekend construction work set forth in § 24-222 of such Code, additional noise mitigation measures and/or techniques shall be implemented when required by DEP.






*§ 28-104 Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan.*


When required by § 24-221 of the Administrative Code or this chapter, a complete and accurate Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan shall be filed with DEP in accordance with § 24-221 of such Code. If and when approved by DEP, such plan shall be conspicuously posted at the job site. When an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan is required, no construction activities shall take place until said plan is filed with and approved by DEP. The Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan Form is available at: http://www.nyc.gov/dep or at DEP's Offices at:

New York City Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Environmental Compliance, 9th Floor 59-17 Junction Blvd. Flushing, NY 11373






*§ 28-105 Utility Noise Mitigation Plan.*


Pursuant to § 24-219 and § 24-220 of the Administrative Code, every authorized publicly franchised New York City utility company that provides gas, electric, steam and telecommunication services, except when emergency work will be performed in three days or less, shall have conspicuously posted, a complete and accurate Utility Noise Mitigation Plan at all sites where construction activities take place. A generic plan per borough may be used to satisfy the filing and posting requirement, provided such plan is posted and filed with the department and otherwise complies with the requirements for a Utility Noise Mitigation Plan. Although the plan need not be filed with DEP, it shall be readily available for inspection should a complaint be filed or during a routine inspection. The Utility Noise Mitigation Plan Form is available at: http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/noise/construction-noise.shtml.








*§ 28-106 Required Noise Mitigation Measures for Utilities.*


a. A utility company conducting construction activity shall self-certify in its Construction Noise Mitigation Plan that all construction tools and equipment have been maintained so that they operate at normal manufacturer's operating specifications, including at peak loading. Such self-certification shall be indicated on the Construction Noise Mitigation Plan form required by 15 RCNY § 28-100. Upon a DEP inspection of the work site, DEP shall use the noise level guidelines in the Federal Highway Administration Roadway Construction Noise Model User's Guide, Jan. 2006, page 3, located in the Appendix to this chapter, as a means of identifying equipment that may be the cause of a noise complaint. If an individual piece of equipment is identified by DEP as exceeding the level specified in such Guide located in the Appendix to this chapter, upon notification by DEP, the responsible party shall have the option of: (i) performing maintenance to demonstrate a good faith effort, notwithstanding the model year of the equipment, to mitigate the noise by a measurable level acceptable to the Department, (ii) replacing the equipment with equipment that complies with said level, or (iii) filing an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan pursuant to 15 RCNY § 28-104, within five business days of said inspection. If the responsible party elects to perform maintenance pursuant to option (i), but cannot demonstrate within five business days a reduction in noise by a measurable level acceptable to the Department, such party shall pursue one of the other two options to the satisfaction of the Department. The failure to exercise and complete one of such three options within five business days of said inspection shall be a violation of this rule.

b. All tools and equipment being operated on site must be equipped with the appropriate manufacturer's noise reduction device. These devices, including but not limited to portable compressors and other such pneumatic tools, such as jackhammers/pavement breakers, shall be equipped with a standard muffler and jacket, free from air or exhaust leaks.

c. Specialized vehicles, including but not limited to compressor trucks, vacuum excavators, pavement-coring, power-roding, flush trucks, and other vehicles with internal combustion motors, shall require additional noise mitigation measures as specified by DEP, such as the use of noise-insulating material that does not interfere with the engine operation and/or other techniques to reduce noise.

d. Portable compressors, generators, pumps and other such devices shall be covered with noise-insulating fabric, which is not to interfere with engine operations, and/or shall employ other techniques to reduce noise.

e. The time of day that work is in progress shall also determine the technology that provides the appropriate noise mitigation. All work that occurs after the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays shall require an after hours work authorization in accordance with § 24-223 of the Administrative Code. From the hours of 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. on weekdays, the utility shall use daytime noise mitigation controls. However, work between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on weekdays and between 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on weekends may be required by DEP to employ additional techniques, including noise blankets and barriers to reduce the level of noise for receptors within 200 feet.

f. Quieter jackhammers, compressors, and other such construction devices shall be used when available and/or may be required by DEP. A program shall be initiated between DEP and the utilities to perform additional noise-testing of construction devices and to make recommendations to DEP for future rules and use of devices.

g. All unnecessary vehicle engine-idling on site shall be prevented in accordance with § 24-163 of the Administrative Code.

h. All steel traffic plates are to be properly installed and secured to the roadway surface in compliance with 34 RCNY § 2-11(10)(e). Within 24 hours after a call to the utility from DEP, plates shall be re-set and secured properly.

i. Notification shall be given to residents within 200 feet of the construction when work is scheduled for longer than 3 days. Such notification shall include information on construction work schedules and locations.

j. The permit-holder shall respond to all noise complaints and/or official notice from DEP the same day as received or the next day if received after regular utility work hours or as may be required by DEP.

k. All new vehicles will be phased in with the installation of quieter backup warning devices in accordance with paragraph 4 of subdivision d of 15 RCNY § 28-102.

l. A formal noise mitigation training program shall be established and implemented for all field-worker supervisory personnel including sub-contractor supervisors. Supervisory personnel shall field-train all field workers in an effort to minimize construction noise.

m. When work is planned near sensitive receptors, including but not limited to schools, hospitals, places of worship, homes for the aging, etc., the permit-holder shall cooperate with the facility owner/operator to coordinate the work whenever possible so as to minimize the impact on the facility and the utility shall use quieter devices and other noise mitigation methods, such as blankets and barriers.

n. A DEP Inspector may visit the site to examine the Utility Noise Mitigation Plan upon receiving a complaint and may require further action to reduce the level of noise. The responsible party will be provided a 24-hour cure period to correct the condition or to file an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan under 15 RCNY § 28-104. If the condition is not corrected after 24 hours or if an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan is not filed with DEP, a Notice of Violation shall be issued. However, there shall be no 24-hour cure period with respect to compliance with 15 RCNY §§ 28-100, 28-101(a), (b), (f), or (h), 28-104, 28-105, and 28-106(a), (b), (d), (g), or (i).

o. Perimeter noise barriers shall be used as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g). All gaps and spaces in the semi-permanent or temporary barriers shall be filled with noise attenuation material, and such barriers shall be placed as close as possible to the noise source to promote greater noise attenuation.

p. [Repealed.]








*§ 28-107 Perimeter Noise Barriers.*


a. Perimeter Noise Barriers - Noise barriers, positioned between construction equipment and receptors, must be used for all construction projects. Such barriers may be semi-permanent given the time and space requirements of the job site. They may be made of wood, plastic, Plexiglas, precast concrete or steel panels, or where work site space permits, natural materials, such as dirt piles or earthen berms.

b. Noise barriers shall be used to reduce noise affecting pedestrians. Being relatively tall and solid, noise barriers form an excellent perimeter and/or security fence around a job site in addition to reducing noise at street level. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

c. When the work site is within 200 feet of a residential receptor, the responsible party that is required to use a work site perimeter noise barrier (or "construction fence") under DOB rules and regulations shall ensure that noise-resistant material fully lines the interior face (facing the work site) of the perimeter barrier, and shall ensure that:

   1. the barrier breaks the line-of-sight between the noise source and indoor receptors within 200 feet and a maximum of 20 feet above grade level where practicable; however, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet, including the balanced canted portion;

   2. the barrier is made of a material sufficiently resistant to noise in accordance with subdivision e of this section; and

   3. there are no leaks or gaps that will allow noise to pass through the barrier.

d. Noise Barrier Design Options.

   1. Semi-permanent noise barriers are barriers that, due to their height, will require some form of anchoring system. Typically, semi-permanent barriers are intended for long term continuous use. Thus they are built out of materials suitable to withstand weather conditions for several years. Materials such as tongue and groove wooden timbers, vertical I-beam posts and lagging, or precast concrete panels, serve very well as semi-permanent noise barriers. Being anchored, semi-permanent barriers can easily extend to heights of 15 feet and must be in accordance with DOB and FDNY rules and regulations.

   2. Where practicable, the responsible party shall build a pitched panel on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptor buildings, however care must be taken to avoid having the barrier tip over from unbalanced loading.

   3. Alternative barriers may be utilized in accordance with site-specific conditions. For example, shipping container (Conex) boxes are likely already available to the responsible party. For example, where work site space permits, these container boxes or truck trailers may be positioned along the edge of the work site to form a semi-permanent noise barrier. These containers are typically 8 feet wide by 8 feet tall and can be double-stacked to form a noise barrier 16 feet in height. The gaps between and/or under container boxes shall be filled-in to avoid having noise flank around or under the container boxes.

   4. There are also several product vendors that design and manufacture noise barrier materials and barrier systems. These special purpose products are available in various colors and materials including wood, plastic, Plexiglas, precast concrete or steel panels. They are available with or without anchoring systems, as needed.

e. Noise Barrier Specifications. Noise barriers shall be made of noise-resistant material sufficient to achieve a Sound Transmission Class (STC) rating of STC 30 or greater, based on sound transmission loss data taken according to ASTM Test Method E90. Such a barrier can provide as much as a 10 dBA insertion loss providing it is positioned as close as possible to the noise source or to the receptors. To be at all effective, the barrier must be long and tall enough to completely block the line-of-sight between the noise source and the receptors. The gaps between adjacent panels must be filled-in to avoid having noise penetrate directly through the barrier.








*§ 28-108 Temporary or Portable Noise Barriers.*


a. Where there is a dedicated lane for such barrier, temporary or portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barriers shall be used for street work lasting longer than 15 days as set forth in this section. All such barriers shall be placed as close as possible to the noise source in order to maximize noise attenuation.

b. Where construction projects are of shorter duration than 15 days and within the property line and do not require perimeter barriers and are within 75 feet of a residential receptor, a temporary or portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier shall be made in accordance with this section.

c. Construction of temporary barrier. Noise barriers shall be made of noise-resistant material sufficient to achieve a Sound Transmission Class (STC) rating of STC 30 or greater, based on sound transmission loss data taken according to ASTM Test Method E90. Such a barrier may provide as much as a 10 dBA insertion loss, provided it is positioned as close as possible to the noise source or to the receptors. To be at all effective, the barrier must be long and tall enough to completely block the line-of-sight between the noise source and the receptors. The gaps between adjacent panels must be filled-in to avoid having noise penetrate directly through the barrier.

   i. Temporary or portable noise barriers, where required, may be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet and must be in accordance with DOB and FDNY rules and regulations. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels may be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent sections shall be filled-in to form a continuous solid barrier surface.

   ii. Wherever practicable, a pitched panel shall be built on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptor buildings; however care must be taken to avoid having the barrier tip over from unbalanced loading. Further, the barrier shall not exceed 15 feet in height including the pitched panel.

d. Noise curtains. Noise curtain material may be mounted or hung over perimeter chain link fences, or draped over small noise sources, to form a flexible noise barrier. The chain link fences can also be attached to the top of jersey bases.

   i. Noise curtains shall be made of a 1/4-inch thick heavy vinyl material, with a noise absorptive quilt attached to one side (the side facing the noise source).

   ii. Noise control curtains shall have a Sound Transmission Class (STC) rating of STC 30 or greater, based on sound transmission loss data according to ASTM Test Method E90. The noise absorptive face of the curtains shall have a Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC) rating of 0.85 or greater, based on sound absorption coefficient data taken according to ASTM Test Method C423.

   iii. Noise curtains of this sort, such as SoundSeal model BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, generally weigh about 1.5 lbs/sq. ft. They come in 4-foot wide sheets complete with grommets and Velcro edges to aid in hanging the curtains and sealing the sheets side-by-side.

e. Noise Tents. A noise tent may be used within the property line.

   i. Noise curtain material may be attached to a metal frame to form a portable enclosure (known as a "noise tent"). The noise tent shall have noise curtain material attached on three sides and on top of the frame, with the remaining side of the frame left open for work access and ventilation.

   ii. A frame size of 8 feet tall by 6 feet wide by 6 feet deep shall allow the tent to be positioned over small noise sources, such as pumps, generators or compressors. The tent may also be used to cover a laborer using hand-held power tools, such as jackhammers, saws or grinders. Caster wheels may be placed under the frame for mobility, or the tent may be picked up and moved with the arm of a backhoe, for example.

(a) General Requirements.

   (1) When a sewer house connection, private pumping station, private sanitary ejector, private sanitary force main house connection, or a private force main is found to be leaking, inoperative or defective at a particular premises, the DEP shall issue a repair order to the Owner of such premises. The repair order shall instruct the Owner to make all necessary repairs and otherwise comply with the requirements of such order within 30 days of the date of issuance of such order, except when the DEP determines that there is an immediate danger to public health, property or to the environment, in which case such order may provide that repairs shall be made immediately upon issuance of such order. For purposes of this section, "ejector" shall mean a mechanical device used to pump or eject sewage.

   (2) If the Owner has not complied with the repair order in the period allowed, the DEP shall shut off the water service tap/wet connection of the premises. All repair work concerning a sewer connection shall be performed by a Licensed Master Plumber, as provided herein.

   (3) If an Owner believes that a repair order has been issued in error or that exigent circumstances exist such that shutting off the tap/wet connection of the premises would result in extreme hardship, the Owner may apply by letter to the Commissioner who shall make a final determination as to whether the repair order was issued in error or whether exigent circumstances exist warranting an abeyance of issuance of the repair order.

   (4) A Licensed Master Plumber shall obtain a sewer connection repair permit prior to performing work pursuant to a repair order on a sewer connection or in compliance with 15 RCNY §§ 31-04(a)(4) and 31-08(a). Upon completion of all necessary repairs by the Licensed Master Plumber and approval by the DEP, a Licensed Master Plumber shall obtain a tap/wet connection permit to restore the water service.

   (5) When the water service is shut off by the DEP, the Owner must engage a Licensed Master Plumber to assume responsibility for the excavation over the tap or wet connection.

Except as specifically provided in this section, every application made pursuant to Executive Order 91  on or after July 18, 1988 shall include a non-refundable fee which shall be submitted to Land Use Review-Central Intake, 2E, 22 Reade Street, New York, New York 10007-1216, and shall be in the form of a check or money order made out to the "Department of City Planning." The fee for an initial application shall be as prescribed in the following Schedule of Charges. The fee for any formal modification of an application shall be ten percent of the amount prescribed in the schedule of charges for an initial application, except that the fee for any formal modification which increases the square footage of the project by more than 30 percent shall be equal to the fee for an initial application for such additional square footage. Agencies of the federal, state or city governments shall not be required to pay fees nor shall any fees be charged if the owner of the building or property affected is a corporation or association organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, or educational purposes, or for one or more such purposes, no part of the earnings of which insures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual, and provided that the property affected is to be used exclusively by such corporation or association for one or more of such purposes. In addition, for applications made on or after July 1, 1987, no fees shall be charged for the project, or such portion thereof, if the Director of the Mayor's Office of Housing Coordination, or any individual succeeding such Director's jurisdiction, certifies that the property affected, or such portion thereof, is to be used for the construction of housing affordable to low, moderate or middle income households. A fee abatement for a portion of such project shall be calculated upon the percentage of the square footage allocated to the affordable housing and shall proportionally reduce the standard fee attributable to the square footage of the entire project, including such affordable housing portion. In no event shall the portion allocated to the affordable housing part of a project be used to decrease the total project square footage so as to place the project into a lower fee category. Fees shall be paid when the application is filed, and these fees may not be combined in one check or money order with fees required pursuant to other land use applications submitted to the Department of City Planning or the City Planning Commission. No application shall be processed by the Department of City Planning or the Department of Environmental Protection until the fee has been paid and twenty-five copies of the application have been filed with the Department of City Planning.

Chapter 49: Spraying Insulating Material
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 49-01 Definitions.*


For the purposes of this chapter, the following term has the following meaning:

Insulating Material. “Insulating Material” means any material or combination of materials, except spray on foam, that restricts the flow of heat energy.








*§ 49-02 Applicability.*


This chapter is not applicable to new construction.








*§ 49-03 Precautions to be Taken During Spraying of Insulating Material.*


No person may cause or permit the spraying of any insulating material in or upon any building or other structure during its construction, alteration or repair, unless he or she complies with the following precautions.

(1) Before the start of spraying operations all floor areas must be shoveled clean. Before the application of insulating material commences, the floor of the areas must be cleared of all objects, material and equipment other than that employed in the application of the insulating material, or all objects, material, and equipment must be covered with plastic or other approved tarpaulins in a manner that prevents the subsequent dispersal of dust.

(2) The entire floor, or the part of the floor to be insulated, must be enclosed with plastic or other approved tarpaulins in a manner that prevents the escape of dust from the enclosure. All interior open areas, such as elevator shafts and stairwells must be enclosed in a manner that prevents the escape of dust from the working area. Stack effect of the shafts and stairwells must be considered in providing proper enclosures. An enclosure will be considered satisfactory only if visible insulating material cannot escape from the enclosure.

(3) Wet insulating material that has fallen to the floor must be shoveled and scraped to prevent dispersal of dried material. This material must be removed no later than the end of the working day. Shoveled and scraped material must be placed in a heavy plastic bag strong enough to resist tearing or breaking under normal handling conditions and clearly marked as containing insulating material waste. The bags must then be placed into containers, pursuant to Section BC 3303.4.2 of the New York City Building Code. The contents of the aforementioned plastic bags must not be transferred to another container and must not be combined with any designated recyclable materials, pursuant to §§ 16-305, 16-306, 16-306.1, 16-307, 16-308 and 16-314 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York. The plastic bags must be placed upon a vehicle for either transfer to a solid waste transfer station, pursuant to 16 RCNY Ch. 4 or disposal at a site approved by the commissioner and regulated under 6 NYCRR Part 360 if located in New York State or that is consistent with the regulations adopted by any locality where such disposal site is located if outside New York State.

(4) All areas used for opening bags containing insulating material and/or changing of containers must be vacuumed with a HEPA air filtration vacuum or a dust collection system.

(5) Signs must be posted outside enclosures warning persons that entering the enclosure without appropriate apparel may be a hazard.

(6) Facilities must be provided and procedures instituted and supervised that prevent the removal and dispersal of insulating material from the construction site on the clothing or other accessories of persons leaving the area. All persons involved in the spraying of insulating material at the site must be furnished with personal protective equipment specified in the applicable Safety Data Sheet, including suitable coveralls which must be left at the site until properly disposed of in plastic garbage bags. No person will be permitted in an area in which spraying or handling of insulating material is underway or has taken place until the final vacuuming referred to in paragraph four of this subdivision has been accomplished, unless such person is furnished with or wears personal protective equipment in accordance with this paragraph.

(7) Any plenum or structures coated with insulating material which are intended for use in circulation of air in the building must be thoroughly cleaned of all debris, dust and waste insulation. All applied insulation material within a plenum or duct must comply with Section MC 602.2.1 of the New York City Mechanical Code.

(8) A person who is fully trained in accordance with current standard industry practice must be assigned the full-time responsibility of supervising the spraying, preparation and clean-up operations to ensure that no insulating material is released from the construction site.

(9) In case of emission of insulation material from the construction site, immediate steps must be taken to cease such emissions which may include work stoppage at the source of the emissions. There must then be immediate and complete clean-up of all material that has escaped the construction site using control measures including but not limited to the use of a water hose and HEPA vacuum that prevent further dispersal of any insulating material into the atmosphere.

Nothing in this section shall preclude the Business Integrity Commission from issuing a financial hardship waiver, pursuant to Section 24-163.11(c) of the Administrative Code.






Chapter 52: After Hours Noise Complaints
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*§ 52-01 After Hours Response Time at Construction Sites.*


(a) (1) When a complaint is made to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) concerning after hours noise at a construction site, DEP staff will determine whether an after hours variance has been issued pursuant to Section 24-223(a) of the New York City Noise Control Code by the Department of Buildings (DOB). If there is no variance, an inspection will be conducted the same day if the complaint is received during likely working hours. If the complaint is not received during likely working hours, the inspection will be conducted the following weekend or during the same after hours period, as applicable.

   (2) For locations with a DOB variance, an inspection will be conducted during the next time period during which the after hours variance is in effect.

(b) For locations with a DOB variance, DEP will prioritize inspections based upon the number of complaints received per location on a given day.

(c) DEP staff should also monitor after hour complaints to identify situations where complaints have been received about three of more construction sites within a one mile radius of each other and were received within four hours of each other. Where feasible and when such complaints were received during likely working hours, the inspections will be conducted at such locations whether or not there is a variance.

(d) (1) If an after hours complaint is received regarding noise occurring on a weekday, DEP staff shall inspect the location the following weekday.

   (2) If an after hours complaint is received regarding noise occurring on a weekend, DEP staff shall inspect at least 95% of such complaints the following weekend, and the remaining percentage of such complaints, if any, shall be inspected the weekend thereafter.








*§ 52-02 After Hours Response Time for Street Work.*


(a) When a complaint is reported to DEP concerning after hours noise from street construction, which would require an after hours variance from the Department of Transportation (DOT), DEP staff will check the DOT website. If there is no variance, or a variance only for that one day, an inspection will be conducted that day or night. If it is unclear from the website if there is a variance, or if there is a variance within the first three days of receiving such complaint, DEP will conduct an inspection to ascertain if there is a DOT permit and to monitor for noise. DEP staff should inspect 75% of all street construction complaints within three days or less. The remainder of the 25% of complaints should be inspected by the fourth day.

(b) DEP staff should also monitor after-hour complaints to identify situations where three or more complaints relate to the same work location and are received within four hours of each other. Where feasible and the three or more complaints are received within working hours, the inspection will be conducted for those locations whether or not there is an after hours variance.






Chapter 54: Community Right-To-Know Law Penalty Schedule
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d) Mitigating and Aggravating Factors:

   (1) All additions and subtractions are cumulative, except that factors J and K cannot be applied together, and factors A, B, and L may only be applied when at least one aggravating factor is also present (i.e., they cannot be used to reduce the penalty to less than the legal minimum).

   (2) Where the application of multiple aggravating factors would cause the legal maximum penalty to be exceeded, the legal maximum penalty (same as the default penalty) shall be imposed.

      A. Subtract $1,750 for compliance by first hearing date.

      B. Subtract $3,750 for compliance by first hearing date.

      C. Add $250 if there are any EHS stored at the facility.
