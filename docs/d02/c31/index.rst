Pursuant to Charter § 1049(3), OATH's jurisdiction includes the authority to render any ruling or order necessary and appropriate under applicable law or agency rule for the just and efficient adjudication of cases.






*§ 1-03 Applicability.* ::


This chapter applies to the conduct of all cases, including trials, pre-trial and post-trial matters, except to the extent that this chapter may be superseded by CAPA or other provision of law.








*§ 1-04 Construction and Waiver.* ::


This title will be liberally construed to promote just and efficient adjudication of cases. This title may be waived or modified on such terms and conditions as may be determined in a particular case to be appropriate by an administrative law judge.








*§ 1-05 Effective Date.* ::


This chapter is effective on the first day permitted by CAPA, § 1043(e), and applies to all cases brought before the OATH Trials Division. However, for cases initiated prior to the effective date of these rules, no act which was valid, timely or otherwise proper under the rules applicable at the time of the act will be rendered improper by the subsequent effectiveness of this chapter.








*§ 1-06 Computation of Time.* ::


Periods of days prescribed in this chapter will be calculated in calendar days, except that when a period of days expires on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the period will run until the next business day. Where this chapter prescribes different time periods for taking an action depending whether service of papers is personal or by mail, service of papers by electronic means will be deemed to be personal service, solely for purposes of calculating the applicable period of time.








*§ 1-07 Filing of Papers.* ::


(a) Generally. Papers may be filed at OATH in person, by mail or by electronic means.

(b) Headings. The subject matter heading for each paper sent by personal service, mail or electronic means must indicate the OATH index number where one has been assigned pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-26(b).

(c) Means of service on adversary. Submission of papers by a party in a case to the administrative law judge by electronic means, mail or personal delivery without providing equivalent method of service to all other parties will be deemed to be an ex parte communication.

(d) Proof of service. Proof of service must be maintained by the parties for all papers filed at OATH. Proof of service must be in the form of an affidavit by the person effecting service, or in the form of a signed acknowledgement of receipt of papers by the person receiving the papers. A writing admitting service by the person to be served is adequate proof of service. Proof of service for papers served by electronic means, in addition to the foregoing, may also be in the form of a record confirming delivery or acknowledging receipt of the electronic transmission.








*§ 1-08 Access to Facilities and Programs by People with Disabilities.* ::


OATH is committed to providing equal access to its facilities and programs to people with disabilities and OATH will make reasonable accommodations requested by people with disabilities. A person requesting an accommodation for purposes of participation in a case at OATH, including attendance as a member of the public, must request such accommodation sufficiently in advance of the proceeding in which the person wishes to participate to permit a reasonable time to evaluate the request. A request for accommodation must be submitted to OATH's Calendar Unit.









**Subchapter B: Rules of Conduct**



*§ 1-11 Appearances.* ::


(a) A party may appear in person, by an attorney, or by a duly authorized representative. A person appearing for a party, including by telephone conference call, is required to file a notice of appearance with OATH. Docketing of a case by an attorney or representative of a party will be deemed to constitute the filing of a notice of appearance by that person. The filing of any papers by an attorney or representative who has not previously appeared will constitute the filing of a notice of appearance by that person, and must conform to the requirements of subdivisions (b), (d) and (e) of this section.

(b) The appearance of a member in good standing of the bar of a court of general jurisdiction of any state or territory of the United States must be indicated by the suffix "Esq." and the designation "attorney for (petitioner or respondent)", and the appearance of any other person must be indicated by the designation "representative for (petitioner or respondent)".

(c) Absent extraordinary circumstances, no application may be made or argued by any attorney or other representative who has not filed a notice of appearance. Any application submitted on behalf of a party or participation in a conference, whether by e-mail, letter or phone, will be deemed an appearance by the attorney or representative. After making such an appearance, the attorney or representative must file a notice of appearance in conformity with subdivisions (b), (d) and (e) of this section.

(d) A person may not file a notice of appearance on behalf of a party unless he or she has been retained by that party to represent the party before OATH. Filing a notice of appearance constitutes a representation that the person appearing has been so retained. Filing a notice of appearance pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section constitutes a representation that the person appearing has read and is familiar with the rules of this subchapter.

(e) Each attorney or representative appearing before OATH must provide his or her address, telephone number, fax number, and an e-mail address on all notices of appearance and must provide prompt written notice of any change in name, address, telephone number, fax number, or e-mail address.








*§ 1-12 Withdrawal and Substitution of Counsel.* ::


(a) An attorney who has filed a notice of appearance must not withdraw from representation without the permission of the administrative law judge, on application. Withdrawals will not be granted unless upon consent of the client or when other cause exists as delineated in the applicable provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

(b) Notices of substitution of counsel must be served and filed with OATH and the opposing party. A party may substitute counsel without leave of the administrative law judge as long as the substitution is made more than twenty days before trial. Applications for later substitutions of counsel will be granted freely absent prejudice or substantial delay of proceedings.








*§ 1-13 Conduct; Suspension from Practice at OATH.* ::


(a) Individuals appearing before OATH must comply with the rules of this chapter and any other applicable rules, and must comply with the orders and directions of the administrative law judge.

(b) Individuals appearing before OATH must conduct themselves at all times in a dignified, orderly and decorous manner. In particular, at the trial, all parties, their attorneys or representatives, and observers must address themselves only to the administrative law judge, avoid colloquy and argument among themselves, and cooperate with the orderly conduct of the trial.

(c) Attorneys and other representatives appearing before OATH must be familiar with the rules of this title.

(d) Attorneys appearing before OATH must conduct themselves in accordance with the canons, ethical considerations and disciplinary rules set forth in the code of professional responsibility in their representation of their clients, in their dealings with other parties, attorneys and representatives before OATH, and with OATH's administrative law judges and staff.

(e) Willful failure of any person to abide by the standards of conduct stated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, may, in the discretion of the administrative law judge, be cause for the imposition of sanctions. Such sanctions may include formal admonishment or reprimand, assessment of costs or imposition of a fine, exclusion of the offending person from the proceedings, exclusion or limitation of evidence, adverse evidentiary inference, adverse disposition of the case, in whole or in part, or other sanctions as the administrative law judge may determine to be appropriate. The imposition of sanctions may be made after a reasonable opportunity to be heard. The form of the trial will depend upon the nature of the conduct and the circumstances of the case.

(f) In the event that an attorney or other representative of a party persistently fails to abide by the standards of conduct stated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, the Chief Administrative Law Judge may, upon notice to the attorney or representative and a reasonable opportunity to rebut the claims against him or her, suspend that attorney or representative from appearing at OATH, either for a specified period of time or indefinitely until the attorney or representative demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Chief Administrative Law Judge that the basis for the suspension no longer exists.








*§ 1-14 Ex Parte Communications.* ::


(a) Except for ministerial matters, on consent, in an emergency, or as provided in 48 RCNY § 1-31(a), communications with the administrative law judge concerning a case must only occur with all parties present. If an administrative law judge receives an ex parte communication concerning the merits of a case to which he or she is assigned, then he or she must promptly disclose the communication by placing it on the record, in detail, including all written and oral communications and identifying all individuals with whom he or she has communicated. A party desiring to rebut the ex parte communication will be allowed to do so upon request.

(b) Communications between OATH and a party docketing a case, to the extent necessary to the placement of a case on the trial calendar or conference calendar pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-26(a), will be deemed to be ministerial communications. Communications between OATH and a party docketing a case, to the extent necessary to a request for expedited calendaring pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-26(c), will be deemed to be emergency communications.









**Subchapter C: Pre-trial Matters**



*§ 1-21 Designation of OATH.* ::


Where necessary under the provision of law governing a particular category of cases, the agency head will designate the Chief Administrative Law Judge of OATH, or such administrative law judges as the Chief Administrative Law Judge may assign, to hear such cases.








*§ 1-22 The Petition.* ::


The petition must include a short and plain statement of the matters to be adjudicated, and, where appropriate, specifically allege the incident, activity or behavior at issue as well as the date, time, and place of occurrence. The petition must also identify the law, rule, regulation, contract provision, or policy that was allegedly violated and provide a statement of the relief requested. If the petition does not comply with this provision, the administrative law judge may direct, on the motion of a party or sua sponte, that the petitioner re-plead the petition.








*§ 1-23 Service of the Petition.* ::


(a) The petitioner must serve the respondent with the petition. The petition must be accompanied by a notice of the following: the respondent's right to file an answer and the deadline to do so under 48 RCNY § 1-24; the respondent's right to representation by an attorney or other representative; and the requirement that a person representing the respondent must file a notice of appearance with OATH. The notice must include the statement that OATH's rules of practice and procedure are published in Title 48 of the Rules of the City of New York, and that copies of OATH's rules are available at OATH's offices or on OATH's website www.nyc.gov/oath.

(b) Service of the petition must be made pursuant to statute, rule, contract, or other provision of law applicable to the type of proceeding being initiated. Absent any such applicable law, service of the petition must be made in a manner reasonably calculated to achieve actual notice to the respondent. Service by certified mail, return receipt requested, contemporaneously with service by regular first-class mail, will be presumed to be reasonably calculated to achieve actual notice. Appropriate proof of service must be maintained.

(c) A copy of the petition and accompanying notices, with proof of service, must be filed with OATH at or before the commencement of the trial.








*§ 1-24 Answer.* ::


The respondent may serve and file an answer to the petition within eight days of service of the petition if service was personal, or within thirteen days of service of the petition if service was by mail, unless a different time is fixed by the administrative law judge. In the discretion of the administrative law judge, the respondent may be required to serve and file an answer. Failure to file an answer where required, may result in sanctions, including those specified in 48 RCNY § 1-33(e).






*§ 1-25 Amendment of Pleadings.* ::


Amendments of pleadings must be made as promptly as possible. If a pleading is to be amended less than twenty-five days before the commencement of the trial, amendment may be made only on consent of the parties or by leave of the administrative law judge on motion.








*§ 1-26 Docketing the Case.* ::


(a) A case must be docketed by filing with OATH a completed intake sheet, and either a petition or a written application for relief. Parties are encouraged to docket cases by electronic means. When a case is docketed, OATH will place it on the trial calendar, the conference calendar, or on open status. Absent prejudice, cases involving the same respondent or respondents will be scheduled for joint trials or conferences, as will cases alleging different respondents' involvement in the same incident or incidents.

(b) When a case is docketed, it will be given an index number and assigned to an administrative law judge. Assignments will be made and changed in the discretion of the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee, and motions concerning such assignments will not be entertained except pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-27.

(c) OATH may determine that the case is not ready for trial or conference and may adjourn the trial or conference, or may remove the case from the trial or conference calendar and place it on open status. In addition, OATH may determine that the case should proceed on an expedited basis, and may direct expedited procedures, including expedited pre-trial and post-trial procedures, shortened notice periods, and/or expedited calendaring.

(d) The party docketing a case may do so ex parte. If the case is placed on the conference calendar or the trial calendar rather than on open status, the party may at the time of docketing also select a trial date and/or conference date ex parte. However, OATH encourages selection of trial and conference dates by all parties jointly. In the event that a party selects a trial date or a conference date ex parte, that party must serve the notice of conference or trial required by 48 RCNY § 1-28, within one business day of selecting that date. Whenever practicable, such notice must be served by personal delivery or electronic means.

(e) Cases docketed with the Trials Division are subject to review by the Chief Administrative Law Judge who shall determine whether the case should proceed at the Trials Division or removed to the Hearings Division.








*§ 1-27 Disqualification of Administrative Law Judges.* ::


(a) A motion for disqualification of an administrative law judge must be addressed to that administrative law judge, accompanied by a statement of the reasons for such application, and made as soon as practicable after a party has reasonable cause to believe that grounds for disqualification exist.

(b) The administrative law judge will be disqualified for bias, prejudice, interest, or any other cause for which a judge may be disqualified in accordance with § 14 of the Judiciary Law. In addition, an administrative law judge may, sua sponte or on motion of any party, withdraw from any case, where in the administrative law judge's discretion, his/her ability to provide a fair and impartial adjudication might reasonably be questioned.

(c) If the administrative law judge determines that his or her disqualification or withdrawal is warranted on grounds that apply to all of the existing administrative law judges, the administrative law judge must state that determination, and the reasons for that determination, in writing or orally on the record, and may recommend to the Chief Administrative Law Judge that the case be assigned to a special administrative law judge to be appointed temporarily by the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The Chief Administrative Law Judge will either accept that recommendation, or, upon a determination and reasons stated in writing or orally on the record, reject that recommendation. A special administrative law judge will have all of the authority granted to administrative law judges under this title.








*§ 1-28 Notice of Conference or Trial.* ::


(a) When a case is placed on either the trial calendar or the conference calendar, and within the time provided in 48 RCNY § 1-26(d), if applicable, the party that placed the case on the calendar must serve each other party with notice of the following: the date, time and place of the trial or conference; each party's right to representation by an attorney or other representative at the trial or conference; the requirement that a person representing a party at the trial or conference must file a notice of appearance with OATH prior to the trial or conference; and, in a notice of a trial served by the petitioner, the fact that failure of the respondent or an authorized representative of the respondent to appear at the hearing may result in a declaration of default, and a waiver of the right to a trial or other disposition against the respondent. The notice may be served personally or by mail, and appropriate proof of service must be maintained. A copy of the notice of conference, with proof of service, must be filed with OATH at or before the commencement of the conference. A copy of the notice of trial, with proof of service, must be filed with OATH at or before the commencement of the trial.

(b) When multiple petitions against a single respondent, or petitions against multiple respondents, are placed on the calendar or calendar conference for joint trial or conference pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-26(a), notice of trial or notice of conference pursuant to this section must include notice of such joinder.








*§ 1-29 Scheduling Other Conferences.* ::


In the discretion of the administrative law judge, and whether or not a case has been on the conference calendar, conferences may be scheduled on application of either party or sua sponte. 






*§ 1-30 Conduct of Conferences.* ::


(a) All parties are required to attend conferences as scheduled unless timely application is made to the administrative law judge. Participants must be prompt and prepared to begin on time. No particular format for conducting the conference is required. The structure of the conference may be tailored to the circumstances of the particular case. The administrative law judge may propose mediation and, where the parties consent, may refer the parties to the Center for Creative Conflict Resolution or other qualified mediators. In the discretion of the administrative law judge, conferences may be conducted by telephone.

(b) At the conference, all parties must be fully prepared to discuss all aspects of the case, including the formulation and simplification of issues, the possibility of obtaining admissions or stipulations of fact and of admissibility or authenticity of documents, the order of proof and of witnesses, discovery issues, legal issues, pre-hearing applications, scheduling, and settlement of the case.

(c) In the event that the case is not settled at the conference, outstanding pre-trial matters, including discovery issues, must be raised during the conference. In the event that the case is not settled at the conference, a trial date may be set, if such a date has not already been set. The parties will be expected to know their availability and the availability of their witnesses for trial.








*§ 1-31 Settlement Conferences and Agreements.* ::


(a) Prior to a conference at which settlement is to be discussed, the administrative law judge assigned to the conference may require each party to provide a pre-conference letter. The pre-conference letter must be sent solely to the administrative law judge by fax or e-mail and marked prominently "CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL FOR USE AT SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE." The pre-conference letter must state succinctly:

   (1) the history of settlement negotiations, if any;

   (2) the party's settlement offer and the rationale for it; and

   (3) any other facts that would be helpful to the administrative law judge in preparation for the conference.

(b) If settlement is to be discussed at the conference, each party must have an individual possessing authority to settle the matter, either present at the conference or readily accessible. A settlement conference will be conducted by an administrative law judge or other individual designated by the Chief Administrative Law Judge, other than the administrative law judge assigned to hear the case. During settlement discussions, upon notice to the parties, the administrative law judge or other person conducting the conference may confer with each party and/or representative separately.

(c) All settlement offers, whether or not made at a conference, will be confidential and will be inadmissible at trial of any case. Administrative law judges must not be called to testify in any proceeding concerning statements made at a settlement conference.

(d) A settlement must be reduced to writing, or, in the discretion of the administrative law judge, placed on the record. In the event that a settlement is reached other than at a conference, OATH must be notified immediately pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-32(f). Copies of all written settlement agreements must be sent promptly to OATH.








*§ 1-32 Adjournments.* ::


(a) Applications for adjournments of conferences or trials will be governed by this section and by 48 RCNY § 1-34 or § 1-50. Conversion of a trial date to a conference date, or from conference to trial, will be deemed to be an adjournment.

(b) Applications to adjourn conferences or trials must be made to the assigned administrative law judge as soon as the need for the adjournment becomes apparent. Applications for adjournments are addressed at the discretion of the administrative law judge, and will be granted only for good cause. Although consent of all parties to a request for an adjournment will be a factor in favor of granting the request, such consent will not by itself constitute good cause for an adjournment. Delay in seeking an adjournment will militate against grant of the request.

(c) If a party selects a trial or conference date without consulting with or obtaining the consent of another party pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-26(d), an application for an adjournment of such date by that other party, especially if such application is based upon a scheduling conflict, will be decided with due regard to the ex parte nature of the case scheduling.

(d) An attorney must file an affirmation of actual engagement prior to a ruling on an adjournment sought on that basis. Such affirmation must state the name and nature of the conflicting matter, the court or tribunal hearing the matter, the judge before whom it is scheduled, the date that the conflicting engagement became known to counsel, and the date, time, place and approximate duration of the engagement.

(e) Approved adjournments, other than adjournments granted on the record, must be promptly confirmed in writing by the applicant, to all parties and to the administrative law judge.

(f) Withdrawal of a case from the calendar by the petitioner will not be subject to the "good cause" requirement of subdivision (b) of this section. However, such withdrawal, other than pursuant to settlement agreement or other final disposition of the case, will be permitted only upon application to the administrative law judge, who may grant or deny the application, either in full or upon stated terms and conditions.

(g) At the discretion of the administrative law judge, a grant of an adjournment may be conditioned upon the imposition of costs for travel, lost earnings and witness fees, which may be assessed against the party causing the need for an adjournment.

(h) If an administrative law judge determines that a case is not ready for trial or conference and that an adjournment is inappropriate, the judge may remove the case from the calendar. Unless otherwise directed by the administrative law judge, the case will be administratively closed if the parties do not restore the matter to the calendar within 30 days.








*§ 1-33 Discovery.* ::


(a) Requests for production of documents, for identification of trial witnesses, and for inspection of real evidence to be introduced at the trial may be directed by any party to any other party without leave of the administrative law judge.

(b) Depositions must only be taken upon motion for good cause shown. Other discovery devices, including interrogatories, will not be permitted except upon agreement among the parties or upon motion for good cause shown. Demands for bills of particulars will be deemed to be interrogatories. Resort to such extraordinary discovery devices will not generally be cause for adjournment of a conference or trial.

(c) Discovery must be requested and completed promptly, so that each party may reasonably prepare for trial. A demand for identification of witnesses, for production of documents, or for inspection of real evidence to be introduced at trial must be made not less than twenty days before trial, or not less than twenty-five days if service of the demand is by mail. An answer to a discovery request must be made within fifteen days of receipt of the request, or within ten days if service of the answer is by mail. An objection to a discovery request must be made as promptly as possible, but in any event within the time for an answer to that request. Different times may be fixed by consent of the parties, or by the administrative law judge for good cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing time periods, where the notice of the trial is served less than twenty-five days in advance of trial, discovery must proceed as quickly as possible, and time periods may be fixed by consent of the parties or by the administrative law judge.

(d) (1) Parties are encouraged to resolve discovery disputes without the intervention of an administrative law judge. A party objecting to discovery should immediately commence discussion with the requesting party to clarify and possibly resolve the dispute.

   (2) Any unresolved discovery dispute must be presented to the assigned administrative law judge sufficiently in advance of the trial to allow a timely determination. A written motion to compel discovery must be served on all parties and the administrative law judge assigned to conduct the trial. The motion must state what efforts the parties have made to resolve discovery disputes. Any party objecting to a discovery motion must state, in writing, the grounds for the objection. In deciding whether to grant a request, the administrative law judge may consider the timeliness of discovery requests and responses and of discovery-related motions, the complexity of the case, the need for the requested discovery, and the relative resources of the parties.

   (3) In ruling upon a discovery motion, the administrative law judge may deny the motion, order compliance with a discovery request, order other discovery, or take other appropriate action. The administrative law judge may grant or deny discovery upon specified conditions, including payment by one party to another of stated expenses of the discovery. Failure to comply with an order compelling discovery may result in imposition of appropriate sanctions upon the disobedient party, attorney or representative, such as the sanctions set forth in 48 RCNY § 1-13(e), the preclusion of witnesses or evidence, drawing of adverse inferences, or, under exceptional circumstances, removal of the case from the calendar, dismissal of the case, or declaration of default.








*§ 1-34 Pre-Trial Motions.* ::


(a) Pre-trial motions will be consolidated and addressed to the administrative law judge as promptly as possible, and sufficiently in advance of the trial to permit a timely decision to be made. Delay in presenting such a motion may, in the discretion of the administrative law judge, weigh against the granting of the motion, or may lead to the granting of the motion upon appropriate conditions.

(b) A moving party must request in writing an informal conference with the administrative law judge before any dispositive motion will be heard. The request must, in no more than two pages, set forth the nature of the motion.

(c) The administrative law judge may in his or her discretion permit pre-trial motions to be made orally, including by telephone, electronic means, or in writing. The administrative law judge may require the parties to submit legal briefs on any motion. Parties are encouraged to make pre-trial motions, or to conduct preliminary discussions and scheduling of such motions, by conference telephone call or by electronic means to the administrative law judge.

(d) When a motion is made on papers, the motion papers must state the grounds upon which the motion is made and the relief or order sought. Motion papers must include notice to all other parties of their time pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section to serve papers in opposition to the motion. Motion papers and papers in opposition must be served on all other parties, and proof of service must be filed with the papers. The filing of motion papers or papers in opposition by a representative who has not previously appeared will constitute the filing of a notice of appearance by that representative, and must conform to the requirements of 48 RCNY § 1-11(b).

(e) Unless otherwise directed by the administrative law judge upon application or sua sponte, the opposing party must file and serve responsive papers no later than eight days after service of the motion papers if service of the motion papers was personal or by electronic means, and no later than thirteen days after service if service of the motion papers was by mail.

(f) The moving party must not file reply papers unless authorized by the administrative law judge, and oral argument will not be scheduled except upon the direction of the administrative law judge.

(g) Nothing in this section limits the applicability of other provisions to specific pre-trial motions. For instance, an application for withdrawal or substitution of counsel is also governed by 48 RCNY § 1-12; an application for an adjournment is also governed by 48 RCNY § 1-32; and an application for issuance of a subpoena is also governed by 48 RCNY § 1-43.









**Subchapter D: Trials and Hearings**



*§ 1-41 Consolidation; Separate Trials.* ::


All or portions of separate cases may be consolidated for trial, or portions of a single case may be severed for separate trials, in the discretion of the administrative law judge. Consolidation or severance may be ordered on motion or sua sponte, in furtherance of justice, efficiency or convenience.






*§ 1-42 Witnesses and Documents.* ::


The parties must have all of their witnesses available on the trial date. A party intending to introduce documents into evidence must bring to trial copies of those documents for the administrative law judge, the witness, and the other parties. Repeated failure to comply with this section may be cause for sanctions, as set forth in 48 RCNY § 1-13(e).








*§ 1-43 Subpoenas.* ::


(a) A subpoena ad testificandum requiring the attendance of a person to give testimony prior to or at a trial or a subpoena duces tecum requiring the production of documents or things at or prior to a trial may be issued only by the administrative law judge upon application of a party or sua sponte.

(b) A request by a party that the administrative law judge issue a subpoena will be deemed to be a motion, and must be made in compliance with 48 RCNY § 1-34 or 48 RCNY § 1-50, as appropriate; provided, however, that such a motion must be made on 24 hours' notice by electronic means or personal delivery of papers, including a copy of the proposed subpoena, unless the administrative law judge directs otherwise. The proposed subpoena may be prepared by completion of a form subpoena available from OATH. The making and scheduling of requests for issuance of subpoenas by telephone conference call to the administrative law judge or by electronic means is encouraged.

(c) Subpoenas must be served in the manner provided by § 2303 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, unless the administrative law judge directs otherwise. The party requesting the issuance of a subpoena will bear the cost of service, and of witness and mileage fees, which will be the same as for a trial subpoena in the Supreme Court of the State of New York.

(d) In the event of a dispute concerning a subpoena after the subpoena is issued, informal resolution must be attempted with the party who requested issuance of the subpoena. If the dispute is not thus resolved, a motion to quash, modify or enforce the subpoena must be made to the administrative law judge.








*§ 1-44 Interpreters.* ::


(a) OATH will provide language assistance services to a party or their witnesses who are in need of such services to communicate at a trial or conference. All requests for language assistance must be made to OATH's calendar unit.

(b) A request for language assistance by telephone may be made at any time before the trial or conference.

(c) A request for in-person interpretation must be made at least five (5) business days before the trial or conference

(d) A request for sign language interpretation must be made at least three (3) calendar days before the trial or conference.








*§ 1-45 Failure to Appear.* ::


All parties, attorneys and other representatives are required to be present at OATH and prepared to proceed at the time scheduled for commencement of trial. Commencement of trial, or of any session of trial, will not be delayed beyond the scheduled starting time except for good cause as determined in the discretion of the administrative law judge. Absent a finding of good cause, and to the extent permitted by the law applicable to the claims asserted in the petition, the administrative law judge may direct that the trial proceed in the absence of any missing party or representative, render a disposition of the case adverse to the missing party, or take other appropriate measures, including the imposition of sanctions listed in 48 RCNY § 1-13(e). Relief from the direction of the administrative law judge may be had only upon motion brought as promptly as possible pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-50 or § 1-52. The administrative law judge may grant or deny such a motion, in whole, in part, or upon stated conditions.








*§ 1-46 Evidence at the Trial.* ::


(a) Compliance with technical rules of evidence, including hearsay rules, will not necessarily be required. Traditional rules governing trial sequence will apply. In addition, principles of civil practice and rules of evidence may be applied to ensure an orderly proceeding and a clear record, and to assist the administrative law judge in the role as trier of fact. Traditional trial sequence may be altered by the administrative law judge for convenience of the parties, attorneys, witnesses, or OATH, where substantial prejudice will not result.

(b) The administrative law judge may limit examination, the presentation of testimonial, documentary or other evidence, and the submission of rebuttal evidence. The administrative law judge may accept testimony at trial by telephone or other electronic means, including video conferencing. Objections to evidence offered, or to other matters, will be noted in the transcript, and exceptions need not be taken to rulings made over objections. The administrative law judge may call witnesses, may require any party to clarify confusion, fill gaps in the record, or produce witnesses, and may question witnesses directly.

(c) In the discretion of the administrative law judge, closing statements may be made orally or in writing. On motion of the parties, or sua sponte, the administrative law judge may direct written post-trial submissions, including legal briefing, proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, or any other pertinent matter.








*§ 1-47 Evidence Pertaining to Penalty or Relief.* ::


(a) A separate trial will not be held as to the penalty to be imposed or the relief to be granted in the event that the petition is sustained in whole or in part.

(b) In the event that a personnel file, abstract of a personnel file, driver record, owner record, or other similar or analogous file is not admitted into evidence at the trial on the merits, the administrative law judge, upon determining that the petition will be sustained in whole or in part, may request that the petitioner forward such file or record to the administrative law judge for consideration relative to penalty or relief. That request may be conveyed to the petitioner or the petitioner's representative ex parte and without further notice to the respondent. The petitioner must forward only the requested file or record, without accompanying material, and such file or record must include only material which is available from the petitioner for inspection by the respondent as of right. In his or her report and recommendation, the administrative law judge will refer to any material from such file or record relied on in formulating the recommendation as to penalty or other relief.








*§ 1-48 Official Notice.* ::


(a) In reaching a decision, the administrative law judge may take official notice, before or after submission of the case for decision, on request of a party or sua sponte on notice to the parties, of any fact which may be judicially noticed by the courts of this state. Matters of which official notice is taken will be noted in the record, or appended thereto. The parties will be given a reasonable opportunity on request to refute the officially noticed matters by evidence or by presentation of authority.

(b) Official notice may be taken, without notice to the parties, of rules published in the Rules of the City of New York or in The City Record. In addition, all parties are deemed to have notice that official notice may be taken of other regulations, directives, guidelines, and similar documents that are lawfully applicable to the parties, provided that any such materials that are unpublished are on file with OATH sufficiently before trial of the case to enable all parties to address at trial any issue as to the applicability or meaning of any such materials. Unpublished materials on file with OATH will be available for inspection by any party or attorney or representative of a party.








*§ 1-49 Public Access to Proceedings.* ::


(a) Other than settlement conferences, all proceedings are open to the public, unless the administrative law judge finds that a legally recognized ground exists for closure of all or a portion of the proceeding, or unless closure is required by law. Trial witnesses may be excluded from proceedings other than their own testimony in the discretion of the administrative law judge.

(b) No person may make or cause to be made a stenographic, electronic, audio, audio-visual or other verbatim or photographic reproduction of any trial or other proceeding, whether such trial or other proceeding is conducted in person, by telephone, or otherwise, except upon application to the administrative law judge or as otherwise provided by law (e.g. N.Y. Civil Rights Law, § 52). Such application must be addressed to the discretion of the administrative law judge, who may deny the application or grant it in full, in part, or upon such conditions as the administrative law judge deems necessary to preserve the decorum of the proceedings and to protect the interests of the parties, witnesses and any other concerned persons.

(c) Transcripts of proceedings made a part of the record by the administrative law judge will be the official record of proceedings at OATH, notwithstanding the existence of any other transcript or recording, whether or not authorized under the previous subdivision of this section.

(d) Unless the administrative law judge finds that legally recognized grounds exist to omit information from a decision, all decisions will be published without redaction. To the extent applicable law or rules require that particular information remain confidential, including but not limited to the name of a party or witness or an individual's medical records, such information will not be published in a decision. On the motion of a party, or sua sponte, the administrative law judge may determine that publication of certain information will violate privacy rights set forth in applicable law or rules and may take appropriate steps to ensure that such information is not published.








*§ 1-50 Trial Motions.* ::


Motions may be made during the trial orally or in writing. Trial motions made in writing must satisfy the requirements of 48 RCNY § 1-34. The administrative law judge may, in his or her discretion, require that any trial motion be briefed or otherwise supported in writing. In cases referred to OATH for disposition by report and recommendation to the head of the agency, motions addressed to the sufficiency of the petition or the sufficiency of the petitioner's evidence will be reserved until closing statements.








*§ 1-51 The Transcript.* ::


Trials will be stenographically or electronically recorded, and the recordings will be transcribed, unless the administrative law judge directs otherwise. In the discretion of the administrative law judge, matters other than the trial may be recorded and such recordings may be transcribed. Transcripts will be made part of the record, and will be made available upon request or as required by law.








*§ 1-51.1 Decision Made on the Record.* ::


An administrative law judge may dispose of a case by making a decision or report and recommendation on the record.






*§ 1-52 Post-Trial Motions.* ::


Post-trial motions must be made in writing, in conformity with the requirements of 48 RCNY § 1-34, to the administrative law judge, except that after issuance of a report and recommendation in a case referred to OATH for such motions, as well as comments on the report and recommendation to the extent that such comments are authorized by law, must be addressed to the deciding authority.

In determining applications for intervention, the administrative law judge will consider the timeliness of the application, whether the issues in the case would be unduly broadened by grant of the application, the nature and extent of the interest of the proposed intervenor and the prejudice that would be suffered by the intervenor if the application is denied, and such other factors as may be relevant. The administrative law judge may grant the application upon such terms and conditions as he or she may deem appropriate and may limit the scope of an intervenor's participation in the adjudication.

If the respondent fails to serve and file such an affidavit within the time allowed by this paragraph, the administrative law judge will declare the respondent to be in default and will preclude the respondent from further participation in the adjudication. If the respondent timely serves and files such an affidavit, the administrative law judge will decide the questions presented, and will either declare the respondent to be in default and preclude the respondent from further participation in the adjudication, or will deny the default in full or upon stated terms and conditions which may include such limitations on the respondent's participation in the adjudication as the administrative law judge deems to be equitable.

(b) A respondent against whom a default has been entered pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may move at any time before issuance of the report and recommendation to open the default.

If the party moving for certification seeks a stay of proceedings, in whole or in part, pending completion of the interlocutory review, the motion for certification must include a statement as to why the failure to grant the requested stay would materially prejudice the party. Certification may also be made, and a stay may be ordered, by the administrative law judge on his or her own motion.

(b) As provided by the Commission's rules (47 RCNY § 1-74), failure of a party to seek interlocutory review of a decision or order does not preclude that party from making such challenge to the Commission in connection with the Commission's review of a report and recommendation in a case, provided that the party timely made its objection known to the administrative law judge and that the grounds for such challenge must be limited to those set forth to the administrative law judge.








*§ 2-31 Proceedings After Issuance of Report and Recommendation.* ::

Chapter 3: Rules of Practice Applicable to Proceedings Brought Before the Environmental Control Board Pursuant to 
--------------------------------------------------




**Subchapter A: General Rules**



*§ 3-11 Definitions.* ::


Definitions in 48 RCNY § 6-01 apply to terms used in this chapter. In addition, as used in this chapter:

"Board" means the Environmental Control Board of the City of New York.

"Executive Director" means the executive director of the Board.








*§ 3-12 Scope of Rules.* ::


This chapter applies to the adjudications of summonses conducted by the Tribunal as authorized by the Board and to other Board proceedings pursuant to § 1049-a of the New York City Charter and provisions of the New York City Administrative Code, any rules and regulations made thereunder, or provisions of New York State law, and special hearings conducted by the Board pursuant to Title 24 of the New York City Administrative Code.

All such adjudications, special hearings and enforcement proceedings will be conducted pursuant to the rules set forth in Chapter 6 of this Title. Where there is a conflict between this chapter and Chapter 6, this chapter takes precedence.








*§ 3-13 Computation of Time for Emergency Action.* ::


Any emergency action taken by the Board that requires action within a 24-hour period will be taken regardless of whether the 24-hour period includes a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.








*§ 3-14 Claims of Prior Adjudication.* ::


Whenever a party claims that a summons was previously adjudicated, the hearing officer must allow both parties to present all relevant evidence on all the issues in the case, including the claim of prior adjudication. If a party has raised a claim of prior adjudication, the hearing officer must not decide such claim, but must preserve the claim for the purposes of subsequent appeal to the Appeals Unit, a panel of Board members, or the Board pursuant to 48 RCNY § 3-15. If, on appeal, a party properly raises and preserves a claim of prior adjudication, the Appeals Unit will review the records of the first and any subsequent hearings in order to assist the panel or Board in determining the claim of prior adjudication. In deciding the claim, the panel or the Board will consider the interests of justice and public safety.








*§ 3-15 Panel or Board Review of Appeals.* ::


(a) The Board will establish panels from among its members to review recommended decisions prepared by the Appeals Unit, pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-19(e), and to issue appeals decisions. A panel may refer a case to the Board for review if the panel is unable to reach a decision. Such case will be considered by the Board and the Board will issue an appeals decision. Unless a party files a request pursuant to Subdivision (b) of this section, the appeals decision of the panel or the Board will be deemed to have been issued by, and become the final determination of the Board, which is also a final determination of the Tribunal. Judicial review of such determination may be sought pursuant to article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR).

(b) Superseding appeals decisions. Within 10 days of the mailing of the Board's appeals decision, a party may apply to the Board for a superseding appeals decision to correct ministerial errors or errors due to mistake of fact or law. The request for a superseding appeals decision must be served upon the non-requesting party. A decision denying a request for a superseding appeal incorporates by reference the initial appeals decision. A decision granting a request for a superseding appeal vacates the initial appeals decision. This superseding appeals decision will become the final determination of the Board, which is also the final determination of the Tribunal. Judicial review of such determination may be sought pursuant to article 78 of the CPLR.








*§ 3-16 Judicial Review When Board Decision is Delayed.* ::


(a) If the Board has not issued an appeals decision within 180 days from the filing of the appeal, or if the Board has not issued a superseding appeals decision within 180 days from the request for superseding appeal, the Respondent may at any time file a petition seeking judicial review of the Hearing Officer's recommended decision pursuant to article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR). Such Respondent may rely on the recommended decision of the Hearing Officer as the final determination of the Board, provided that the following three conditions are met:

   (1) at least forty-five days before the filing of such petition, the Respondent files with the Board written notice of the Respondent's intention to file the Article 78 petition;

   (2) the Respondent serves and files the article 78 petition on the Board pursuant to the CPLR; and

   (3) the Board has not issued an appeals decision or, if applicable, a superseding appeals decision at the time of filing the petition.

(b) The Board may issue a final determination after a Respondent files with the Board written notice of intention to file a petition for judicial review under Subdivision (a) and before the Respondent has filed the petition.








*§ 3-17 Admission After Default.* ::


Where the Board issues a default decision, in accordance with 48 RCNY § 6-20, permitting Respondent to admit the charge and pay by mail, Respondent may enter a late admission and payment by mail within thirty days of the mailing date of the default decision. OATH may impose a fee of $30 for the processing of such late admission.








*§ 3-18 Stipulation in Lieu of Hearing.* ::


(a) At any time before the Hearing Officer issues a recommended decision, the Petitioner may offer the Respondent a settlement of the summons by stipulation in lieu of further hearing. The stipulation must contain an admission of the violation, the further facts stipulated to, if any, the amount of the penalty to be imposed, and the compliance ordered, if any.

(b) If entered into by Respondent and filed with the Tribunal prior to the first scheduled hearing date, the stipulation will be reviewed by the Executive Director or his or her designee. The Tribunal as authorized by the Board will, after receiving such stipulation, issue a final decision incorporating the terms of the stipulation. If the stipulation is not acceptable to the Tribunal, the matter will be rescheduled for further hearing.

(c) If entered into during the course of a hearing and approved by the Hearing Officer, the stipulation will be incorporated into the Hearing Officer's recommended decision.

(d) Decisions based upon stipulations may not be appealed.








*§ 3-19 Post Judgment Amendment of Records.* ::


(a) Upon the written motion of any party, the Board may amend any judgment to designate a judgment debtor by the correct legal name.

(b) The movant must file the written motion with the Executive Director. The movant must also file an affidavit setting forth the facts and evidence relied on and an affidavit of service, by certified or registered mail and regular mail, of the motion on the judgment debtor at the last known address and at the address or addresses at which the summons was or summonses were served. Such motion must be served on the judgment debtor and any other party. The motion must set forth the date and time of the hearing in accordance with the direction of the Executive Director, provided that such date and time will not be sooner than ten (10) days after the service of such motion on the judgment debtor. At such hearing, any party may appear, in person or otherwise, with or without an attorney, cross-examine witnesses, present evidence and testify. If the judgment debtor does not appear at the hearing, the Hearing Officer may proceed to determine the evidence presented by the movant in support of the motion.

(c) If the Hearing Officer finds that the movant has established, by a preponderance of evidence, (i) the correct legal name of the judgment debtor, (ii) that such name is the same party designated on the summons or summonses as responsible for the alleged violation or violations and (iii) that service of the summons or summonses and of all other papers in the proceeding or proceedings was or were properly made upon such judgment debtor, the Hearing Officer will grant such motion and issue a recommended decision directing the amendment of the judgment to reflect the correct legal name of the judgment debtor and of all records relating to the proceedings commenced by the service of the summons or summonses, including the records of judgments filed with the civil court and in the office of the county clerk.

(d) The Hearing Officer will file the recommended decision with the Board and OATH will serve the recommended decision on all parties. Any party who appeared at the hearing, in person or otherwise, may file an appeal of such recommended decision in the manner provided in 48 RCNY § 6-19 and the Board will render a final decision on the appeal. Such final decision is the final decision of the Board for purposes of review pursuant to article 78 of the CPLR.

(e) If an appeal is not filed within the time provided for in 48 RCNY § 6-19, the Hearing Officer's recommended decision will become the final decision of the Board and is not subject to review pursuant to article 78 of the CPLR.

(f) An order correcting a judgment does not affect the duration of a judgment. The judgment will remain in full force and effect for eight (8) years from the date that the judgment was originally entered.









**Subchapter B: Special Hearings**



*§ 3-21 Cease and Desist Actions.* ::


(a) Scope. This section governs cease and desist actions brought by the Board pursuant to Administrative Code §§ 24-178, 24-257, or 24-524, after Respondent has had notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the violations alleged pursuant to the provisions of §§ 24-184, 24-263, or 24-524 as appropriate, and has failed to comply with orders issued by the Board in such proceedings.

(b) Issuance of Order and Notice. Cease and desist actions are commenced by the Board issuing an order to cease and desist and a notice of special hearing. The order and notice will identify the particular compliance order, previously issued after an adjudicatory hearing or finding of default, which Respondent is alleged to have disregarded, and the activity, equipment, device and/or process involved. The order will direct Respondent to show cause at a special hearing why the equipment, device or process should not be sealed and additional penalties should not be imposed, and will notify Respondent that, if Respondent does not appear as directed, the Board's order will be implemented.

(c) Service. The order to cease and desist and notice of special hearing will be served personally and by regular mail.








*§ 3-22 Special Hearing.* ::


(a) Pre-Sealing Hearing. The special hearing will be presided over by a Hearing Officer who has all of the powers and duties in subchapter C of Chapter 6 of these rules, except as specifically provided in this section. The Hearing Officer may receive evidence presented by the Petitioner who requested the Board to issue the cease and desist order, any intervenor, and the Respondent.

(b) Motions to Intervene.

   (1) A person may intervene as of right in a special hearing if such person may be directly and adversely affected by a cease and desist order of the Board. An order imposing a monetary penalty is not an order directly or adversely affecting any person other than a Respondent.

   (2) Such person intervening as of right must file a written application with the Tribunal and serve it upon each party to the proceeding not less than five (5) days before the special hearing. Such written application must set forth in detail the reasons why the person seeks to intervene. When such written application is made by any person, the matter will be assigned to a Hearing Officer for disposition. Within three (3) days of being served with such written application, any party may file a response and any supporting documents with the Tribunal. Such response and documents, if any, must be served upon the applicant and all other parties.

   (3) An intervenor as of right will have all the rights of an original party, except that the Hearing Officer may provide that the intervenor will be bound by orders previously entered or evidence previously received and that the intervenor will not raise issues or seek to add parties which might have been raised or added more properly at an earlier stage of the proceeding.

(c) Report. In lieu of a recommended hearing decision, the Hearing Officer will prepare a report summarizing the evidence and arguments and including the Hearing Officer's findings of fact and recommendation as to whether the sealing should proceed and additional penalties should be imposed. The Hearing Officer will promptly file the report with the Board.

(d) Board Order. Upon receipt of the Hearing Officer's report, the Board may adopt, reject or modify the findings and recommendation, and direct such further hearings or issue such further orders to Respondent as are appropriate under the circumstances to assure correction of the violations. In any case in which the Board issues an order requiring the Respondent to take affirmative action, such order may also require the Respondent to file with the Board a report or reports attesting under oath that the Respondent has complied with the order. Failure to file a required report within the time limit set forth in the order may, in the Board's discretion, constitute a violation of the order regardless of whether the Respondent has otherwise complied with the provisions of the order.

(e) Post-Sealing Hearing. At any time after a sealing has taken place, a Respondent may request a special hearing to present evidence as to why the seal should be removed or sealing order modified. The Respondent must make the request by letter addressed to the Board or the Executive Director or his or her designee. A special post-sealing hearing will then be scheduled and presided over by a Hearing Officer and conducted in accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section.








*§ 3-23 Application for a Temporary or Limited Unsealing or Stay.* ::


If it appears that remediation undertaken by a Respondent cannot proceed or its effectiveness cannot be tested while a seal remains in place, the Respondent may, by written application addressed to the Executive Director or his or her designee, request that a seal be temporarily removed or stayed for a limited period. The Executive Director or his or her designee may authorize a temporary unsealing or stay of sealing for the above specified reasons for such limited period and subject to such conditions as the Executive Director or his or her designee deems appropriate.








*§ 3-24 Hearings after Emergency Cease and Desist Orders.* ::


When the Board has issued an emergency cease and desist order, without hearing, due to an imminent peril to public health or safety, pursuant to Administrative Code §§ 24-178(f), 24-346(a) and (e) or 24-523(a) and (b), any person affected by such emergency order may, by written notice to the Board, request a hearing or an accelerated hearing in accordance with those provisions. The hearing held pursuant to the request will be held by the Board and not referred to a Hearing Officer. The hearing will otherwise be conducted in accordance with the relevant provisions of law and the applicable Board rules for adjudicatory hearings.

A persistent violation may only be found where such violation occurs at a building of nine or more dwelling units. Each container or bag containing solid waste that has not been source separated or placed out for collection in a manner consistent with the regulations promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed a separate violation. However, no more than twenty separate violations may be issued on a per bag or per container basis during any twenty-four hour period.

Chapter 5: Rules Applicable to Violations of Laws or Regulations Enforced by the Taxi and Limousine Commission
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 5-01 Scope of this Chapter.* ::


This chapter applies to all charges of violations of any laws, rules and regulations enforced by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).

Definitions in 48 RCNY § 6-01 apply to terms used in this chapter.








*§ 5-01a Appearances* ::


(a) Appearances by Respondent. A Respondent’s appearance at a hearing is timely if the Respondent appears and is ready to proceed no more than ninety (90) minutes after the scheduled hearing time.

(b) Appearances by Petitioner. If the Petitioner fails to appear within thirty (30) minutes of the timely appearance of the Respondent and does not make a timely request to reschedule the hearing pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-05, the Tribunal will dismiss the summons.

(c) If the hearing does not begin within three (3) hours of the timely appearance of both the Respondent and the Petitioner, the Tribunal will dismiss the summons without prejudice.








*§ 5-02 Respondent's Right to Confront Complaining Witness* ::


(a) Pursuant to Administrative Code § 19-506.1, the TLC must produce the complaining witness in person where such witness's credibility is relevant to the summons being adjudicated. If the TLC is unable to produce such witness in person, the TLC must make reasonable efforts to make the witness available during the hearing by videoconferencing or teleconferencing.

(b) If the TLC is unable to produce the witness in person or by videoconference or teleconference, it must provide the Hearing Officer with a statement outlining its efforts to produce the witness. If the Hearing Officer determines that the TLC's efforts were inadequate, the Hearing Officer will dismiss the summons.

(c) If the Respondent previously requested an adjournment to obtain the testimony of the complaining witness, the non-attendance of the complaining witness will be considered a failure by the TLC to produce a complaining witness under paragraph (b) and may be grounds for the Hearing Officer to dismiss the summons.








*§ 5-03 Respondent's Right to Challenge a Default Decision* ::


Pursuant to Administrative Code § 19-506.1, a Respondent may move to vacate a default decision by filing a written motion to vacate within two (2) years from the date of entry of the default decision.








*§ 5-04 Appeals* ::


(a) If a Hearing Officer issues a decision imposing a reduced penalty pursuant to 48 RCNY § 5-06(c), the party seeking to appeal the Hearing Officer’s underlying decision must file an appeal with the Tribunal within fifty (50) days of the date of the decision.

(b) Pursuant to Administrative Code § 19-506.1(c), a Respondent will not be required to pay the fines, penalties, or restitution imposed in the decision in order to file a timely appeal.

(c) Expedited appeals. Either party may appeal a decision pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-19. Where the appeal involves the suspension or revocation of a TLC-issued license, the Appeals Unit will issue an expedited decision.

(d) A party responding to a request for appeal where the appeal involves the suspension or revocation of a TLC-issued license must file the response with the Tribunal within seven (7) days after being served with the appeal. The responding party must also serve a copy of the response on the appealing party, and file proof of such service with the Tribunal.

(e) Requests for hearing recording. Pursuant to Administrative Code § 19-506.1(d), if a Respondent appealing a decision requests in writing a copy of the hearing recording, the recording will be produced to the Respondent within thirty (30) days after receipt of the request. If the recording cannot be produced within the thirty (30) day period, the determination being appealed will be dismissed without prejudice.

(g) Finality. A decision of the Appeals Unit becomes the final determination in the case, unless either party petitions the TLC Chairperson in accordance with § 35 RCNY 68-12(c).








*§ 5-05 Chairperson Review* ::


(a) Scope of review of appeals unit decisions. The TLC Chairperson or, if designated by the TLC Chairperson, the General Counsel for the TLC, may review any determination of the Appeals Unit that interprets any of the following:

   (1) A rule in Title 35 of the RCNY;

   (2) A provision of law in Chapter 5 of Title 19 of the Administrative Code;

   (3) A provision of law in Chapter 65 of the Charter.

(b) Decision. Upon review, the TLC Chairperson or General Counsel may issue a decision adopting, rejecting or modifying the Appeals Unit decision. The TLC Chairperson or General Counsel will be bound by the findings of fact in the record and will set forth his or her decision in a written order. The TLC Chairperson or General Counsel's interpretation of the TLC's rules and the laws it administers will be considered agency policy and must be applied by the Tribunal in future adjudications involving the same rules or statutes.








*§ 5-06 Special Procedures* ::


(a) Summary suspension based on a failure to be timely tested for drug use. When the TLC submits to the Tribunal written documentation pursuant to 35 RCNY § 68-16(d) submitted by a Licensee, as defined in 35 RCNY § 51-03, refuting summary suspension based on a failure to be timely tested for drug use, the Tribunal will issue a decision based on the written documentation. The decision will include findings of fact and conclusions of law. The decision may be appealed in accordance with the process established in 48 RCNY § 6-19.

(b) Unlicensed activity. Pursuant to § 19-529.2 of the Administrative Code, a decision on unlicensed activity with a commuter van will be issued within one (1) business day of the conclusion of the hearing or the default.

(c) Discretion of Hearing Officers to reduce penalties.

   (1) A Hearing Officer may, in the interest of justice, impose a reduced penalty for a violation, except for a violation of § 19-507 of the Administrative Code, after determining that such reduction in penalty is appropriate on the ground that one or more compelling considerations or circumstances clearly demonstrates that imposing such penalty would constitute or result in injustice. In determining whether such compelling consideration or circumstance exists, the Hearing Officer must, to the extent applicable, consider, individually and collectively, the following factors:

      (i) The seriousness and circumstances of the violation;

      (ii) The extent of harm caused by the violation;

      (iii) The evidence supporting or refuting the violation charged, whether admissible or inadmissible at a hearing;

      (iv) The history, character, and condition of the Respondent;

      (v) The effect of imposing upon the Respondent the penalty set by the TLC;

      (vi) The impact of a penalty reduction on the safety or welfare of the community;

      (vii) The impact of a penalty reduction on public confidence in the TLC, the Tribunal, and the implementation of laws by the City;

      (viii) The position of the Petitioner regarding the proposed fine reduction with reference to the specific circumstances of the Respondent and the violation charged; and

      (ix) Any other relevant fact indicating whether a decision to impose the penalty set by the TLC on the Respondent would serve a useful purpose.

   (2) Upon determining that a penalty should be reduced, the Hearing Officer will set forth in the decision the monetary penalty, if any, to be imposed on the Respondent, the amount of the reduction, and the reasons for such reduction.

   (3) Within twenty (20) business days of receipt of the Hearing Officer's decision, the TLC Chairperson or the Chairperson's designee may, upon determining that such decision is not in the interest of justice, pursuant to the factors set forth in Paragraph (1) of this subdivision, re-impose the full penalty demanded by the TLC or increase the penalty imposed by the Hearing Officer.

**Subchapter C: Hearings**



*§ 6-08 Proceedings before the OATH Hearings Division.* ::


(a) Issuance and Filing of Summons.

   (1) The petitioner must file an original or a copy of the summons, together with proof of service, with the Tribunal prior to the first scheduled hearing date. Electronic filing of the summons and proof of service is required unless the Tribunal grants an exception. Failure to timely file all proofs of service shall not divest the Tribunal of jurisdiction to proceed with a hearing or to issue a default order.

   (2) Notwithstanding paragraph one of this subdivision, where property has been seized, the Tribunal may adjudicate a summons after it is served and before it is filed.

(b) Service of the Summons. There must be service of the summons.

   (1) Service of a summons in the following manner will be considered sufficient:

      (i) The summons may be served in person upon:

         (A) the person alleged to have committed the violation,

         (B) the permittee, licensee or registrant,

         (C) the person who was required to hold the permit, license or to register,

         (D) a member of the partnership or other group concerned,

         (E) an officer of the corporation,

         (F) a member of a limited liability company,

         (G) a managing or general agent, or

      (ii) Alternatively, the summons may be served by mail deposited with the U.S. Postal Service, or other mailing service, to any such person at the address of the premises that is the subject of the summons or, as may be appropriate, at the residence or business address of:

         (A) the alleged violator,

         (B) the individual who is listed as the permittee, licensee or applicant in the permit or license or in the application for a permit or license,

         (C) the registrant listed in the registration form, or

         (D) the person filing a notification of an entity's existence with the applicable governmental agency where no permit, license or registration is required.

         If the summons is served by mail, documentation of mailing will be accepted as proof of service of the summons.

   (2) A summons may be served pursuant to the requirements of § 1049-a(d)(2) of the New York City Charter, 35 RCNY Chapter 68, or as provided by the statute, rule, or other provision of law governing the violation alleged. For the purpose of serving a summons pursuant to New York City Charter § 1049-a(d)(2)(a)(i) and (ii), the term "reasonable attempt" as used in New York City Charter § 1049-a(d)(2)(b) may be satisfied by a single attempt to effectuate service upon the Respondent, or another person upon whom service may be made, in accordance with Article 3 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules or Article 3 of the Business Corporation Law.

   (3) The Tribunal's decision may be automatically docketed in Civil Court where the summons has been served in accordance with § 1049-a(d)(2) of the New York City Charter or the statute or rule providing for such docketing. Where a summons is lawfully served in a manner other than that provided in § 1049-a(d)(2) or such other provision of law, the Tribunal may hear and determine such summons but the decision will not be automatically docketed in Civil Court or any other place provided for entry of civil judgments without further court proceedings.

(c) Contents of Summons. The summons must contain, at a minimum:

   (1) The name and address, when known, of a Respondent;

   (2) A clear and concise statement sufficient to inform the Respondent with reasonable certainty and clarity of the essential facts alleged to constitute the violation or the violations charged, including the date, time where applicable, and place when and where such facts were observed;

   (3) Information adequate to provide specific notification of the section or sections of the law, rule or regulation alleged to have been violated;

   (4) Information adequate for the Respondent to calculate the maximum penalty authorized to be imposed if the facts constituting the violation are found to be as alleged;

   (5) Notification of the date, time and place when and where a hearing will be held by the Tribunal or instructions to the Respondent on how to schedule a hearing date. Such date must be at least fifteen (15) calendar days after the summons was served, unless another date is required by applicable law. Where Respondent waives the fifteen (15) day notice and requests an expedited hearing, the Tribunal may assign the case for immediate hearing, upon appropriate notice to Petitioner and opportunity for Petitioner to appear.

   (6) Notification that failure to appear at the place, date and time designated for the hearing will be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing, thereby authorizing the rendering of a default decision; and

   (7) Information adequate to inform the Respondent of his or her rights under 48 RCNY § 6-09.

(d) In the interest of convenient, expeditious and complete determination of cases involving the same or similar issues or the same parties, the Tribunal may consolidate two (2) or more summonses for adjudication at one (1) hearing.

(e) Where a Petitioner withdraws a summons, even if it has been adjudicated, is open or has been decided by the Tribunal, the Petitioner must promptly notify the Tribunal and the Respondent in writing. Thereafter the Tribunal will issue a decision indicating the summons has been withdrawn.








*§ 6-09 Appearances.* ::


(a) A Respondent may appear for a hearing personally or be represented by:

   (1) an attorney admitted to practice law in New York State, or

   (2) a representative registered to appear before the Tribunal pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-23, or

   (3) any other person authorized by a Respondent to appear at or before the Tribunal on behalf of the Respondent, as set forth in 48 RCNY § 6-23(a).

(b) A Respondent may appear for a hearing by:

   (1) Appearing in person or by representative at the place, date, and time scheduled for the hearing. Respondent’s appearance is timely if Respondent or Respondent’s representative appears at the scheduled hearing location and is ready to proceed within three (3) hours of the scheduled hearing time for a summons. However, a representative or attorney appearing on fifteen (15) or more summonses on a given hearing date must comply with the requirements set forth in 48 RCNY § 6-24 to be considered timely; or

   (2) Appearing by remote method pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-10, only where the summons indicates that such opportunity is available to a Respondent. Where the summons requires personal appearance, a Respondent must appear pursuant to subsection (1) of this subdivision.

(c) Where the terms of a summons authorize a Respondent to do so, a Respondent may also appear by admitting the violation charged on the summons and paying the penalty for the cited violation in the manner and by the time directed in the summons. Payment in full is deemed an admission of liability and no further hearing or appeal will be allowed.

(d) Current Owner of a Property.

   (1) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a prior owner of a property is named on the summons, the current owner of a property may appear on behalf of the prior owner if the summons:

      (A) involves a premises-related violation, and

      (B) was issued after title to the property was transferred to the current owner.

   (2) The current property owner may appear for purposes of presenting a deed and indicating when title passed.

   (3) The current owner of the property may also present a defense on the merits of the charge only if the current owner agrees to substitute him or herself for the prior owner and waives all defenses based on service.

(e) Failure to Appear by Respondent. A Respondent’s failure to appear timely pursuant to subsection (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, or to make a timely request to reschedule pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-05, constitutes a default and subjects the Respondent to penalties in accordance with 48 RCNY § 6-20.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, attorneys or registered representatives who appear on fifteen (15) or more summonses on a given hearing date must comply with the requirements set forth in 48 RCNY § 6-24. Failure to do so constitutes a default and subjects the Respondent to penalties in accordance with 48 RCNY § 6-20.

(g) A Petitioner may appear for a hearing through an authorized representative at the place, date and time scheduled for the hearing or by remote methods when the opportunity to do so is offered by the Tribunal. If Petitioner elects to appear at the Tribunal, Petitioner’s appearance for a hearing is considered timely if Petitioner is ready to proceed within thirty (30) minutes of the timely appearance by Respondent.

(h) Failure to Appear by Petitioner. If Petitioner fails timely to appear at the scheduled place, date and time, pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section, the hearing may proceed without the Petitioner.








*§ 6-10 Remote Adjudications.* ::


(a) When the opportunity to do so is offered by the Tribunal, a Respondent may contest a violation by mail, online, by telephone or by other remote methods.

This does not include copies of documents submitted to the Tribunal during a hearing including written or electronic statements and exhibits. Except as otherwise provided by law, such application must be addressed to the Hearing Officer, who may deny the application or grant it in full, in part, or upon such conditions as the Hearing Officer deems necessary to preserve the decorum of the proceedings and to protect the interests of the parties, witnesses and any other concerned persons.

(b) Prohibited Communication.

   (1) All parties must be present when communications with Tribunal personnel, including a Hearing Officer, occur, except as necessary for case processing and unless otherwise permitted by these rules, on consent or in an emergency.

   (2) All persons are prohibited from initiating communication with a Hearing Officer or other employee before or after a hearing or before or after a decision on motion, in order to attempt to influence the outcome of a hearing or decision on motion.

(c) Penalties for Misconduct.

   (1) Failure to abide by these rules constitutes misconduct. The Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee may, for good cause, suspend or bar from appearing before the Tribunal an attorney or representative who fails to abide by these rules. The suspension may be either for a specified period of time or indefinitely until the attorney or representative demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee that the basis for the suspension no longer exists.

   (2) However, the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee may not act until after the attorney or representative is given notice and a reasonable opportunity to appear before the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee to rebut the claims against him or her. The Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee, depending upon the nature of the conduct, will determine whether said appearance will be in person or by a remote method.

   This section in no way limits the powers of a Hearing Officer as set out in 48 RCNY § 6-13.

(d) Discipline on Other Grounds.

   (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section, the Chief Administrative Law Judge may summarily suspend or bar a representative upon a determination that the representative lacks honesty and integrity and that the lack of honesty and integrity will adversely affect his or her practice before the Tribunal.

   (2) Any action pursuant to this subdivision will be on notice to the representative. After the summary suspension or bar, the representative will be given an opportunity to be heard in a proceeding prescribed by the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee. Factors to be considered in determining whether a representative lacks honesty and integrity include, but are not limited to, considering whether the representative has made false, misleading or inappropriate statements to parties or Tribunal staff.

(e) Judicial Review. The decision of the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee under subdivision (c) or (d) of this section constitutes a final determination. Judicial review of the decision may be sought pursuant to Article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules.








*§ 6-26 Request for a New Hearing Due to Unauthorized Representation.* ::


Notwithstanding any other provision of these rules, a party may, within three (3) years after a decision pursuant to a hearing has become final, move to vacate the decision on the grounds that the person who appeared on the party's behalf at the hearing was not authorized to do so. Upon a determination that the person who appeared was not authorized to represent the party, the Tribunal may vacate the decision and schedule a new hearing. In exceptional circumstances and in order to avoid injustice, the Tribunal will have the discretion to grant a motion to vacate a decision after the three (3) year period has lapsed.








*§ 6-27 Defense Based on Sovereign or Diplomatic Immunity.* ::


(a) A Respondent may present a defense based on sovereign or diplomatic immunity:

   (1) in a written submission received no later than seven (7) business days before the hearing date stated on the summons, in which the Respondent may admit or deny the violation charged and the Tribunal will assign the matter to a Hearing Officer; or

   (2) at a hearing orally or in writing, but only if an attorney or authorized representative of the Petitioner is present at the hearing or if the Respondent at that time consents to an adjournment of the hearing; or

   (3) in a response submitted in any case in which adjudication by remote method is allowed pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-10.

   (1) adjourning the hearing for no less than thirty (30) and no more than sixty (60) days;

   (2) setting forth in detail the violations alleged in the summons; and

   (3) giving notice to the City entity charged with serving as the official liaison with foreign governments ("liaison") that the Respondent has presented a defense based on sovereign or diplomatic immunity, in which event the Tribunal will promptly serve such order to such liaison.

(c) After an adjournment is granted under subdivision (b), either party may request to extend the time period of the adjournment. The Hearing Officer must grant such request if it is accompanied by a written submission from the liaison indicating more time is necessary for the parties to resolve the matter.

(d) (1) At a hearing held following an adjournment granted pursuant to subdivision (b), the Hearing Officer must issue a determination whether or not the Respondent is entitled to sovereign or diplomatic immunity.

   (2) If the Hearing Officer determines that the Respondent is entitled to sovereign or diplomatic immunity, he or she must dismiss the summons without a determination of the Respondent's liability.

   (3) If the Hearing Officer rejects the defense of sovereign or diplomatic immunity, a hearing on the violation must be conducted pursuant to the rules governing hearings in this Chapter.








*§ 6-28 Application to File a Post-Hearing Agreement.* ::


A written application to file a post-hearing agreement must be made jointly and with the consent of all the parties to a matter. Such applications must be made to the designated Deputy Commissioner of OATH, or his or her designee as approved by the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The post-hearing agreement will not amend the Hearing Officer's final written decision and when filed, will become part of the record.

*§ 101  A City Administrative Law Judge Shall Uphold the Integrity of the Tribunal on Which He or She Serves.* ::


The administration of justice in our City depends on tribunals that adjudicate fairly, without partiality, prejudgment or impropriety. A City administrative law judge should participate in establishing, maintaining and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall personally observe those standards so that the integrity of the tribunal on which he or she serves will be preserved. The provisions of these Rules are to be construed and applied to further that objective. Persons covered by these Rules remain subject to Chapter 68 of the City Charter and the rules and opinions issued by the Conflicts of Interest Board interpreting those provisions. To the extent that these Rules conflict with the provisions of Chapter 68 or the rules or opinions of the Conflicts of Interest Board, the provisions of Chapter 68 and the rules and opinions of the Conflicts of Interest Board shall take precedence unless these Rules are more restrictive. Persons covered by these Rules remain subject to Executive Order 16 of 1978 and amendments thereto, and to all other applicable City rules and executive orders. Nothing in these Rules shall limit the duty of City administrative law judges to comply with Chapter 68, the rules and opinions of the Conflicts of Interest Board, Executive Order 16 of 1978 and amendments thereto, and any additional obligations imposed by rules, guidelines or directives issued by agencies or tribunals, or the duty of administrative law judges in the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings ("OATH") to comply with the Code of Judicial Conduct as set forth in the Rules of the Chief Administrative Judge of the Courts for the State of New York, 22 NYCRR §§ 100 et seq.

(F) Practice of law.

   (1) Consistent with all other provisions of these Rules, with Chapter 68 of the Charter and the rules and opinions of the Conflicts of Interest Board, any applicable agency or tribunal rules and with all other provisions of law, a City administrative law judge may practice law, as long as such activity affects neither the independent professional judgment of the City administrative law judge nor the conduct of his or her official duties.

(b) A Respondent is eligible for Community Service if the Respondent admits to a Specified Violation alleged in a summons before a hearing date, or if the Specified Violation is sustained after a hearing.

(c) A Respondent is not eligible for Community Service if the Specified Violation arose during the conduct of commercial activity or activity carried out for a commercial purpose, except when the commercial activity alleged is a violation of Administrative Code § 18-146(c)(15).








*§ 7-03 Choosing Community Service.* ::


(a) Community Service After a Hearing.

   (1) If a Respondent is eligible for Community Service because the Specified Violation is sustained after a hearing as described in 48 RCNY § 7-02, the Respondent will receive a Decision that gives the Respondent the option either to complete Community Service or to pay the applicable monetary civil penalty by a specified date. If the Respondent wants to complete Community Service, the Respondent may contact OATH's Help Center to schedule Community Service. If the Decision gives the option to complete one or two-hours of Community Service, the Respondent may complete OATH's online Community Service course.

   (2) If a Respondent fails to complete the Community Service as set forth in 48 RCNY §§ 7-04 and 7-05, the applicable monetary civil penalty will be reinstated. The monetary civil penalty will be due and owing thirty (30) days from the date of the Decision, or thirty-five (35) days if the Decision is mailed.

(b) Admitting by Completing OATH's Online Community Service Course on or Before a Hearing Date.

   (1) A Respondent who wants to admit to a Specified Violation that has a one- or two-hour community service requirement in accordance with 48 RCNY § 7-02 will have the option of admitting to the Specified Violation by completing OATH's online Community Service course on or before the hearing date. The completion of the online Community Service course constitutes an admission to the violation.

   (2) If a Respondent fails on or before the hearing date to complete OATH's online Community Service course or pay the applicable monetary penalty, and does not appear at the hearing, the Respondent will be in default pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-20.








*§ 7-04 Amount of Community Service in Place of a Monetary Civil Penalty.* ::


The number of hours of Community Service imposed will correspond to the amount of the monetary civil penalty imposed for a Specified Violation, consistent with New York City Charter Section 1049(4)(e). The number of hours of Community Service for each Specified Violation is in the chart set forth in 48 RCNY § 7-02(a).








*§ 7-05 Completion of Community Service.* ::


(a) A Respondent must complete either the Community Service assigned by OATH's Help Center or, if applicable, OATH's online Community Service course.

(b) Deadline to Complete Community Service.

   (1) If a Respondent is completing Community Service after a hearing was held, the Community Service must be completed by the date specified in the Decision, unless otherwise specified in a notice granting an extension, or an order issued, pursuant to 48 RCNY § 7-07.

   (2) If a Respondent is admitting by completing OATH's online Community Service course, the online Community Service course must be completed on or before the hearing date.

(c) Certificate of Completion.

   (1) Within two (2) days after the specified date of completion in a Decision, a notice granting an extension, or an order issued, pursuant to 48 RCNY § 7-07, the Help Center must provide to Respondent either:

      (A) a Certificate of Completion indicating that the Community Service was completed by the specified date; or

      (B) a Certificate of Non-Completion indicating that the Community Service was not completed by the specified date.

   (2) If a Respondent completes OATH's online Community Service course, the Respondent will receive immediate confirmation that the online Community Service course was completed.

(d) If a Respondent who either receives a Certificate of Non-Completion, or does not receive immediate confirmation that the online Community Service course was completed, believes that they have timely completed Community Service, they may contact OATH's Clerk's Office. The Clerk's Office will review any information or documentation submitted in support of Respondent's claim that Community Service was completed on time. The burden of proof is on the Respondent to show timely completion of the Community Service. If the Clerk's Office finds that Community Service was completed on time, Respondent will not have to pay the monetary civil penalty.








*§ 7-06 Extension to Complete Community Service.* ::


(a) A Respondent may request an extension of time to complete the Community Service through the Help Center prior to the deadline to complete the Community Service specified in the Decision.

(b) Extensions of time to complete Community Service are not available for Respondents who wish to admit to the Specified Violation by completing OATH’s online Community Service course on or before the hearing date.

(c) (1) OATH’s Help Center may grant a request for an extension to complete Community Service for good cause shown. In determining whether there is good cause for an extension, the Help Center will consider factors such as the following:

      (A) The length of extension requested;

      (B) The number of hours of Community Service to be completed and the amount of the monetary civil penalty that would be due;

      (C) The number of prior extensions requested;

      (D) Whether the need for the extension is due to factors beyond Respondent’s control or due to extraordinary circumstances; and

      (E) Whether a portion of the Community Service has been completed.

   (2) A denial of a request for an extension is not subject to appeal at OATH.

   (3) A request for extension of time to complete Community Service will not extend the date by which a Respondent must pay the monetary civil penalty. If a request for an extension is denied, the Respondent must either complete the Community Service by the date specified in the Decision, or pay the applicable monetary civil penalty thirty (30) days from the date of the Decision or thirty-five (35) days if the Decision is mailed.








*§ 7-07 Respondent Appeal of a Decision After Requesting Community Service.* ::


(a) If a Respondent who has chosen to perform Community Service instead of paying a monetary civil penalty timely appeals the Decision sustaining the Specified Violation, pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-19, the part of the Decision ordering completion of Community Service will be stayed until a decision on the appeal is issued. A Respondent will not be required to complete the Community Service or pay the applicable monetary civil penalty in order to file an appeal.

(b) If a Respondent’s appeal is denied, the Respondent must either complete the Community Service within twenty (20) days of the date of the appeal decision, or pay the monetary civil penalty, unless otherwise specified in a notice granting an extension.








*§ 7-08 Choosing Community Service After a Specified Violation is Sustained on Agency’s Appeal.* ::

If the Respondent fails to do so within ten (10) days of the date of the decision on the appeal, the monetary civil penalty will be due and owing immediately.

(b) If the Respondent chooses to perform community service, Respondent will receive an order granting a timely request and imposing a deadline to complete the Community Service. The monetary civil penalty will be due and owing if the Respondent fails to perform the Community Service by the deadline in the order.
