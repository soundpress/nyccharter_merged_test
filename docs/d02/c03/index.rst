*§ 3-02 Prominence and Placement.*


All information required by these rules and regulations to appear on a container shall be prominent, definite and plain and shall be conspicuous as to size and style of letters and numbers and as to color of letters and numbers in contrast to color of background. The declaration of identity, if required, and the net quantity statement shall appear on the principal display panel. The name and address of the manufacturer, packer or distributor shall appear either on the principal display panel or on any other appropriate panel. Any required information that is either in hand lettering or hand script shall be entirely clear and equal to printing in legibility.






*§ 3-03 Declaration of Identity.*


Any commodity sold or offered for sale in a container shall bear on the outside or top thereof a definite, plain and conspicuous declaration of the identity of the commodity unless the same can easily be identified through the container. Such identification shall positively identify the commodity by its common or usual name, description, generic term or the like.






*§ 3-04 Declaration of Quantity.*


Any commodity sold or offered for sale in a container shall bear on the outside or top thereof a definite, plain and conspicuous declaration of the net quantity of the contents in terms of weight, measure or count except where otherwise provided by law.






*§ 3-05 Declaration of Responsibility.*


Any commodity sold or offered for sale in a container shall bear on the outside or top thereof a definite, plain and conspicuous declaration of the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer or distributor.






*§ 3-06 Correct Marking in Units of Weight or Measure.*


(a) Prescribed units. A declaration of quantity shall be expressed in terms of the largest whole unit of weight or measure (for example, 1 quart liquid shall be expressed as "1 quart liquid" and not as "2 pints liquid" or "32 fluid ounces"). However, when this results in a whole number and a fraction, the fraction may be expressed in its equivalent in the next smaller whole unit (for example, 1 3/4 quarts liquid may be expressed as "1 quart 1 1/2 pints liquid" or "1 quart 1 pint 8 fluid ounces," but not as "1 quart 24 fluid ounces" 1 1/4 pounds may be expressed as "1 pound 4 ounces").

(b) When the commodity is liquid, the markings shall be in terms of liquid measure: when the commodity is solid, semi-solid, viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid, the markings shall be in terms of weight, (except where otherwise provided by the Commissioner), provided that if the commodity is packaged in an aerosol container, the declaration shall be in terms of net weight (including the propellant).

(c) Where packaged food or food products are sold or offered for sale with quantity representations in decimals, an adequate equivalent weight chart shall be posted at or near the items so sold or offered for sale.

(d) When a food product is packaged in a liquid preservative or is enclosed along with a packing substance, the net quantity of such food product shall be expressed in terms of the drained net weight of the food product when removed from the container, exclusive of the liquid preservative or the packing substance.






*§ 3-07 Qualifying Words Prohibited.*


When commodities are sold or offered for sale by weight, measure or numerical count, and the containers are so marked, no qualifying word or phrase or clause shall be used. Statements such as "Minimum weight," "Not less than," "Average," "When packed," or similar qualifying phrases are prohibited nor shall any unit of weight, measure or count be qualified by any term (such as "Jumbo," "Giant," "Full" or the like) that tends to exaggerate the amount of commodity.






*§ 3-08 Units with Two or More Meanings.*


When any unit of weight or measure having two or more distinct meanings is employed in a declaration of quantity, the declaration shall identify the particular meaning of the term as it is employed in the declaration. For example, distinction shall be made between "avoirdupois" and "fluid" ounces and between "liquid" and "dry" quarts and pints. However, such distinction may be omitted when, by association of terms (as in "1 pound 4 ounces" or "1 pint 8 fluid ounces"), the proper meaning is obvious.






*§ 3-09 Count to be Supplemented.*


A declaration of quantity in terms of count shall be supplemented by a declaration of the weight, measure or size of the individual units of the commodity or of the total weight or measure of the commodity, unless a declaration of count alone is fully informative to the consumer.






*§ 3-10 Weight or Measure to be Supplemented.*


A declaration of quantity in terms of weight or measure shall be supplemented by a declaration of the count or size of the individual units of the commodity, unless a declaration of weight or measure alone is fully informative to the consumer.






*§ 3-11 Metric System.*


A declaration of weight or measure in United States customary units may be supplemented by a declaration in units of the metric system.






*§ 3-12 Language.*


All information required by these rules and regulations to appear on a container shall appear thereon in the English language. A translation in any language other than English of such information may supplement the representations on the container to provide fuller consumer information.

(a) Any commodity, whether edible or inedible, sold by weight, standard measure, or numerical count, shall be marked so as to display its total selling price.

(b) The following commodities, however packaged or contained when offered for retail sale, shall indicate the appropriate price per measure as well as the total selling price: (1) meat and fish

   (2) bread

   (3) cereals

   (4) cooking oils

   (5) carbonated soft drinks and beer

   (6) napkins, facial tissue and toilet tissue

(c) The appropriate price per measure shall be defined as:

   (1) the price per pound for non-liquid items measured by weight

   (2) the price per quart for liquids

   (3) the price per fifty units for non-liquid products sold by numerical count.

The posting is fulfilled by putting at least one label on each face of each gasoline dispenser through which the gasoline is sold. If two or more kinds of gasoline are sold with different octane ratings from a single dispenser, then separate labels must be placed for each kind of gasoline on each face of the dispenser.

(b) (1) The label or labels must be placed conspicuously on the dispenser so as to be in full view of consumers as near as reasonably practical to the price per gallon of the gasoline.

   (2) Petitions for an exemption from the placement requirements are to be submitted in writing to the secretary of the United States Federal Trade Commission. The petition must include the reasons for the desired exemption.

(c) (1) If the gasoline is not blended with other gasoline, then the posting must be consistent with the certified octane rating. If the gasoline is blended with other gasoline, then the posting must be consistent with the determination of the average, weighted by volume, of the certified octane ratings for each gasoline in the blend, or consistent with the lowest octane rating certified for any gasoline in the blend. Whether the gasoline is blended or not, a retailer may choose to post the determination of the octane rating according to the method below, which is in accordance with Part 306.4 of the Federal Trade Commission regulations.

   (2) To Determine Octane Rating.

      (i) Refiners, importers or producers must determine the octane rating of all gasoline before it is transferred. This can be done by the refiner, importer, producer, or through a testing lab.

      (ii) (A) To find the octane rating, add the research octane number and the motor octane number and divide by two as explained by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) in ASTM-D 439-78, entitled "Standard Specifications for Automotive Gasoline." To determine the research octane number, use ASTM standard test method D 2699-75 and to determine the motor octane number, use ASTM standard test method D 2700-75.

         (B) If ASTM changes these standards, there will be a 30-day comment period, beginning after the Commission publishes the change in the FEDERAL REGISTER. During this time, Commission staff or any person affected by the change may petition the Commission not to adopt the change because it is a change in the procedures for determining octane ratings, or to extend the length of time of the grace period that follows the comment period. If based on comments, the Commission decides to permit incorporation of the change into the rule. The change will become effective 60 days after expiration of the comment period, unless this period is extended by the Commission. If the Commission decides not to permit automatic incorporation, formal procedures may be initiated to evaluate the change.

(d) (1) Retailers must maintain and replace labels as needed to make sure consumers can easily see and read them.

   (2) If the labels are destroyed or are unusable or unreasonable for some unexpected reason, a retailer may post a temporary label as much like the required label as possible. However, the required label must be posted as soon as possible.

   (3) Retailers who receive gasoline from a common carrier, must receive, from the common carrier, a certification of the octane rating of the gasoline, either by letter or on the delivery ticket or other paper.

Chapter 5: Unfair Trade Practices
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




**Subchapter A: Consumer Protection Law**



*§ 5-01 Definitions.*


Consumer. "Consumer" means an individual who buys or leases consumer goods or services, and that individual's co-obligor or surety.

Consumer goods and services. "Consumer goods and services" means goods or services (including credit) that are primarily for personal, household, or family purposes.

Item. "Item" means goods and services.

Legal name. "Legal name" means:

(1) the true corporate name of a corporation; or

(2) the name of at least one partner of a partnership; or

(3) the name of at least one owner of a business that is not a corporation or a partnership.

Seller. "Seller" means any individual or business that offers to sell or lease consumer goods or services. "Seller" includes manufacturers, wholesalers, and others who are responsible for any act or practice regulated by this code.






*§ 5-06 The Word "Free" and Similar Representations.*


(a) Scope. This section governs the use of the words "free," "gift," "given without charge," "bonus," "1¢ additional," and any other terms which imply that an item, as defined in 6 RCNY § 5-01, is free or offered at a nominal cost in the sale or offering for sale of any consumer goods or services. It governs signs inside stores, storefront advertising, handbills and all other types of written advertisement, but not advertising on packages placed thereon by a person or entity other than the retailer. In this section, the word "free" refers to any word or phrase of similar meaning. A "free offer" is an offer involving the use of any such word or phrase.

(b) Disclosure of conditions on free offers. A seller who imposes a condition on a free offer must describe the condition clearly and conspicuously. The description of every condition on a free offer must be placed near the word "free." An asterisk or other symbol near the word "free," which refers the customer to a footnote containing conditions, does not satisfy this section. This condition must be in print at least half as large as the print used for the word "free."

(c) Free offers conditioned upon another purchase.

   (1) The "regular price" is the price at which an item has been actively and openly sold by the seller for a substantial period of time in the recent past.

   (2) A seller who makes a free offer contingent upon another purchase may not:

      (i) charge more than the regular price for the item; or

      (ii) reduce the item's quantity or quality; or

      (iii) continuously make such offer or repeat it so frequently that the two items are being sold in combination at one price; or

      (iv) make such offer in connection with the sale of an item that is usually sold at a price negotiated with consumers.

(d) Combination offers. This section permits non-deceptive "combination" offers, in which two or more items (for example, toothpaste and a toothbrush) are offered for sale as a single unit at a single stated price.






*§ 5-07 Number Size in Advertised Prices.*


(a) Sellers who advertise a price over one dollar must state the number of cents in figures at least one-half as tall and broad as the figures used to state the number of dollars.

(b) This section does not apply when the advertised price is stated in whole dollar amounts. For example, if the price is $6.00, the zeros may be less than half the size of the six.






*§ 5-08 Sales Promotions.*


Sellers must comply with the provisions of § 369-ee of the New York State General Business Law ("Prize award schemes").






*§ 5-09 Limitations on Offers.*


(a) Sellers offering consumer goods or services in print advertising and promotional literature must disclose clearly and conspicuously all material exclusions, reservations, limitations, modifications or conditions. A disclosure made in print at least one-third as large as the largest print used in the advertisement or promotional literature satisfies this section. Examples: If the following facts are true, they must be disclosed:

   (1) In an advertisement for an item sold from more than one location:

      (i) locations which do not have certain items mentioned and

      (ii) locations which charge rates higher than those mentioned in the advertisement. Where such locations are not known and cannot be reasonably ascertained, a seller must include the following statement in the advertisement: "Not available at all locations." The seller shall also include a statement in the advertisement that indicates how a consumer may obtain information about the availability of an item at a specific location such as: "Check with your local store for availability."

   (2) That advertised prices are available only during certain days or times.

   (3) That advertised prices are available only if complete sets are purchased.

   (4) That minimum or maximum amounts must be purchased for advertised prices to apply.

   (5) That there are trade-in requirements.

   (6) That there are additional charges for delivery or for mail orders.

(b) Offers in radio or television advertising must include oral statements of any material exclusions, limitations, modifications or conditions.

(c) This section does not apply when another law or regulation specifically provides a different rule for the disclosure of exclusions, reservations, limitations, modifications or conditions.






*§ 5-10 Deceptive Classified Ads.*


(a) Dealers, brokers, or business entities advertising in the classified section of a newspaper, magazine or other printed media must disclose that they are businesses.

(b) An advertiser can disclose that it is a business by use of the word "dealer," "broker," or other similar terms.

(c) Examples: A dealer's classified ad which reads: "Dodge '68 $795, Call OF7-1452" would not satisfy the requirements of this Regulation because it does not disclose that the advertiser is a business. A classified ad which reads: "3 room apt., $160, call Acme Rental, Inc." sufficiently discloses that the advertiser is a business.






*§ 5-11 Limited Editions.*


(a) Items offered for sale to consumers may not be described as limited unless their edition, printing, minting, crafting, or production is restricted to either:

   (1) A predetermined maximum quantity; or

   (2) The actual quantity ordered or subscribed to within a specified, reasonably short time. All terms that indicate that production of a product is limited are covered by this section.

(b) Any claim that a product is limited must state the maximum quantity or the specific time period or date by which the product must be ordered. This statement must be made clearly and conspicuously and close to the claim or limitation.






*§ 5-12 Prices in Multi-Product and Multi-Service Advertisements.*


(a) In any advertisement for two or more similar items or services, when a range of prices is stated, or the existence of a range is implied, the highest price must be stated in figures at least as tall and broad as the figures in the lowest price stated. The existence of a range is implied where words such as, but not limited to, "from," "as low as," "beginning at," "starting at," or "______ and up" are used in an advertisement. This subdivision (a) applies even where an advertisement discloses the price of all items and services.

(b) Any prices stated must relate to specific items or services.

(c) If the price of items or services is unascertainable, any price or prices stated must include the average price for which the goods or services were sold by the advertiser during the previous year or selling season. Such a price must be described as the "average price."






*§ 5-13 Advertisements Claiming to Boost the Immune System.*


(a) It is a deceptive trade practice to make a claim or to imply in an advertisement that the use of a product or treatment will boost, enhance, stimulate, assist, cure, strengthen or improve the body's immune system unless such advertisement discloses either:

   (1) the effect of the treatment or use of the product on an HIV-positive person or a person with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) or;

   (2) that use of the products or treatment has not been proven to prevent primary infection with HIV, nor is to be a cure for AIDS, nor to extend the life or improve the health of an HIV-positive person or a person infected with AIDS.

(b) Any claimed effects of the treatment or use of the product on an HIV-positive person or a person with AIDS in an advertisement shall be deemed a deceptive practice unless such claims are capable of being substantiated by scientific documentation including, but not limited to, medical clinical trials, small scale and informal clinical trials, compilations of clinical data from patients or other clinical information. Such documentation must support any claimed effects of the treatment or use of the product on an HIV-positive person or a person with AIDS. All documentation must be made available at the request of a consumer.

(c) All disclosures and words of limitation or qualification as required by this section shall be written or printed in letters at least one third as high and one third as broad as the largest words or numbers appearing in the advertisement, but in no event in less than ten point type./n radio announcements, the disclosure or words of limitation or qualification shall be clearly spoken, and in television announcements they shall be part of the audio track and not merely part of the picture.






*§ 5-21 Compliance with Federal, State and Local Laws Regarding the Extension of Credit.*


(a) Scope. This section applies to all persons and businesses engaging in activities relating to consumer credit. In this section, such persons and businesses are called creditors.

(b) Creditors must comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws relating to consumer credit.






*§ 5-22 [Reserved]*


Merchants who accept payment from a consumer that will be applied to the purchase of merchandise on a "layaway plan," as such term is defined in § 396-t of the New York General Business Law, must comply with all the requirements of that section.






*§ 5-24 Credit Card Limitations.*


(a) A seller who accepts credit cards must conspicuously disclose every limitation the seller imposes on their use.

(b) Disclosures required by this section must appear at or near every entrance to the seller's business premises and in all advertising that indicates credit cards are accepted.






*§ 5-31 Future Services Contracts.*


(a) Definition. A contract for consumer services that will be provided on a continuing basis is a "contract for future consumer services." However, this section does not apply to:

   (1) boarding accommodations;

   (2) travel arrangements made less than a year in advance;

   (3) the sale of goods which include warranties of service and repair;

   (4) services by non-profit educational institutions.

(b) Liability for cancellation. A consumer who cancels a contract for future services cannot be charged more than the full contract price. However, up to the amount of the full contract price, the consumer may be charged the total of the following amounts:

   (1) 5 percent of the cash price, or $50, whichever is less;

   (2) the cost to the seller for any goods the consumer used or the consumer is keeping; (3) the portion of the full contract price representing services received by the consumer (if a consumer cancels a contract for lessons by missing consecutive lessons that represent at least 25 percent of the lessons in the entire course, those missed lessons up to 25 percent can be treated as services received by the consumer).

(c) Prompt refunds. If a buyer has paid a seller more money than this section allows a seller to keep, the seller must refund the extra payment, or make a refund available, within ten days of cancellation.

(d) Cancellation. Cancellation occurs when:

   (1) the consumer mails the seller notice of intent to cancel; or

   (2) the seller actually knows the consumer intends to cancel; or

   (3) the consumer misses consecutive lessons that represent at least 25 percent of an entire course, and the consumer does not inform the seller in writing that he or she intends to remain enrolled.

(e) Notice. The seller's contract form must conspicuously disclose the seller's refund policy, and must contain the following notice in a prominent place: IF YOU CANCEL THIS CONTRACT (THE SELLER) MAY KEEP ONLY 5% OF THE CASH PRICE UP TO A MAXIMUM OF $50, PLUS A PORTION OF THE CONTRACT PRICE BASED UPON THE LESSONS OR SERVICES YOU HAVE USED. YOU MAY NOTIFY (THE SELLER) OF YOUR INTENT TO CANCEL BY MAIL, ADDRESSED TO (THE SELLER) AT (SELLER'S ADDRESS).






*§ 5-32 Documentation of Transactions.*


(a) Definitions. 

   Audio equipment. "Audio equipment" means any apparatus or equipment that is used for sound reproduction, including but not limited to amplifiers, phonographs, radios, receivers, speakers, tape players, tape recorders and turntables.

(d) Exemptions. This section applies to the retail sale of all consumer goods and services except:

   (1) food or drink intended for on-premises consumption; or

   (2) oil, gasoline or parking fees paid for in cash. Sellers of these goods and services must provide consumers with receipts upon request if the amount of a purchase is more than five dollars.

(f) Other documents. Upon request, a seller must provide a consumer with a copy of any document related to the sale which was signed by the consumer.






*§ 5-33 Transactions Negotiated in Spanish.*


(a) Scope. This section applies to the purchase or lease of consumer goods and services by means of an agreement to pay in installments.

*§ 5-38 Goods Temporarily in Short Supply.*


(a) Scope. This section governs the sale of items which are temporarily in short supply because of extraordinary circumstances. Extraordinary circumstances can include fuel shortages, weather conditions, power failures, and strikes which result in limited deliveries of items to New York City consumers.

(b) Declaration of temporary shortage. The Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs shall make declarations about items temporarily in short supply by:

   (1) filing a declaration as soon as possible with the City Clerk; and

   (2) publishing the declaration as soon as possible in The City Record; and

   (3) sending the declaration to the media specified in § 1043 of the New York City Charter. A declaration of temporary shortage shall expire in 30 days, unless it is terminated sooner by declaration. The Commissioner may issue a renewed declaration of temporary shortage upon expiration of the original declaration.

(c) Unconscionable sales practices. A seller of items the Commissioner has declared in short supply may not:

   (1) increase prices in excess of an amount reflecting normal market fluctuations, except in accordance with the exemption rules in 6 RCNY § 5-38(e);

   (2) require consumers to purchase another item in order to get the item in short supply, if no additional purchase was required before the shortage;

   (3) require the purchase of a minimum quantity of the item in short supply;

   (4) fail to give all consumers an equal opportunity to purchase the item in short supply (to the extent that such opportunity existed before the temporary shortage). A seller may, however, give preference to a category of consumers having a special health- or safety-related need for the item in short supply.

(d) Deceptive sales practices prohibited. A seller of items the Commissioner has declared temporarily in short supply:

   (1) may not represent falsely that an item is not available;

   (2) must disclose any limitation or condition on sale of an item conspicuously in a sign at the point of sale.

(e) Exemption.

   (1) A seller of items the Commissioner has declared temporarily in short supply may increase prices in excess of an amount reflecting normal market fluctuations if he or she can show that additional costs have been incurred in providing the item, through no fault of the seller or as a result of the seller's attempt to give consumers additional opportunities to purchase the item (for example, by increasing the hours during which an item can be purchased). This exemption only applies to the increased cost incurred by the seller.

   (2) This exemption does not apply when another law or regulation prohibits a price increase.

   (3) A seller using this exemption must keep records, for one year, of the increased costs incurred. The records shall be made available upon demand to the Department of Consumer Affairs.

(f) Failure to comply with this section within two days of an original declaration will not result in any penalty if the seller proves that he or she did not know of the declaration.

(a) Cancellation of home appointments. 

   (1) When a seller makes an appointment with a consumer to pick up, deliver, inspect or repair goods at the consumer's home, the seller must keep the appointment or give the consumer written or verbal notice of cancellation. The notice must be received before the end of the business day before the day of the appointment. If it is impossible for the seller to give notice by the end of the day before the appointment day, the seller must give notice as soon as possible.

   (2) When verbal notice is given, the seller must mail a notice of the cancellation the next day. This need not be done, however, if the seller and consumer reschedule the appointment for a date within three days of the date the seller cancelled.

   (3) A seller may cancel an appointment without notice only if the cancellation is caused by the consumer, by natural disaster, or by strike. Employee illness and mechanical breakdown do not relieve the seller of the obligation to give notice.

(b) Record keeping. A seller who cancels an appointment must prepare, and keep for one year, a record with the following information:

   (1) seller's name;

   (2) consumer's name and address;

*§ 5-46 Car Rental.*


(a) Reservations. A motor vehicle rental business which reserves vehicles for consumers must make available either the vehicles reserved, or one which seats at least as many passengers as the one reserved and is suitable for the consumer's purposes, within one-half hour of the reserved time, either at the reserved location or at another location to which the consumer is transported without charge. This subdivision (a) does not apply if the consumer is told when the reservation is made that the reservation is not guaranteed. The business must fulfill all other terms of the reservation.

(b) Deceptive advertising. A motor vehicle rental business which rents to consumers may not advertise or represent that reservations can be made, unless it maintains procedures to comply with this Regulation.

(c) Records. A business which reserves vehicles for consumers must maintain procedures reasonably calculated to fulfill those reservations. This includes maintaining records of all reservations, and of the scheduled return times of all rented vehicles. These records must be preserved for at least 6 months, and shall be made available for inspection and copying by the Department of Consumer Affairs.

(d) Required sign. A motor vehicle rental business which rents vehicles to consumers must conspicuously display on the business premises a sign or notice entitled "Department of Consumer Affairs Consumer Protection Law Rule." The sign shall be not less than twelve (12) inches by eighteen (18) inches in dimension, with letters thereon to be not less than one (1) inch high.

The following statement complies with this requirement:

   If you have made a reservation for a car (or truck), that reservation must be honored at the price originally promised, within one-half hour of the time originally promised, unless you are told when you make the reservation that it is not guaranteed. To report complaints, contact the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, (Insert the Department's current address), Complaint Phone: (Insert the Department's current complaint telephone number).






*§ 5-47 Jewelry Sellers and Appraisers.*


(a) Definitions.

   Jewelry. "Jewelry" means unset rare gems, precious stones and semi-precious stones, and articles for personal wear which contain rare gems, precious stones or semi-precious stones.

   Standard of monetary value. "Standard of monetary value" means the basis for measurement such as retail replacement value, wholesale value, or resale value.

(b) Jewelry appraisals – requirements.

   (1) Every written appraisal must state the standard of monetary value used, clearly and on the same side of the paper that contains the appraised value. If the standard used is the retail replacement value, the appraisal form must contain a notice which states clearly and conspicuously:

      (i) that the appraisal value is the approximate price at which retail jewelry stores would sell the item;

      (ii) that the consumer should not expect to be able to sell the item at the appraised value;

      (iii) that appraisers' opinions as to the value of jewelry vary by as much as 25 percent; and

      (iv) that the appraiser does not guarantee that it will buy the item from the consumer if the consumer desires to resell it in the future. (If the appraiser is willing to make such a guarantee, then it must state the price at which it will buy the item.) This disclosure need not be made if the appraiser never buys jewelry from members of the public.

   (2) Example: The following notice would satisfy the requirements of 6 RCNY § 5-47(b), in the case of an appraiser who also buys from the public and who is not willing to make any guarantees concerning purchase:

      Notice – This appraisal tells you the approximate price at which you could replace this article with comparable merchandise at a retail jewelry store which normally sells jewelry of like quality. You should not expect to be able to sell the article for this amount. The opinions of appraisers concerning value vary by up to 25 percent. This company does not promise to buy the article from you at the appraised value or at any fraction of the appraised value.

(c) Jewelry sales – requirements. A seller who offers to sell an article of jewelry for more than $75.00 must give to the buyer, at or before the time of sale, a written sales slip which conspicuously contains:

   (1) the price;

   (2) in the case of a diamond or any article containing a diamond, the weight of the diamond(s) stated in the manner and within the limits of tolerance established by the Federal Trade Commission; and

   (3) a description of the article, stating all materials of which it is composed. [;If a synthetic gem's composition is a trade secret, its trade name may be disclosed instead of its actual composition; in such a case, the words "imitation" or "synthetic" must be placed immediately before or after the trade name.];

(d) Sales and appraisals – prohibited practices. A seller may not mislead the consumer about any characteristic of the jewelry, including its type, kind, name, grade, quality, quantity, size, weight, cut, color, character, substance, durability, origin, prior ownership, price or value.

(b) In this section, substitute items of "equal or better" quality means items that are substantially similar to the items ordered, that fit the purposes for which the ordered items were intended; and that are not normally offered by the seller at a lower price than the price of the ordered items.

(c) 6 RCNY § 5-48(a) does not apply to:

   (1) items ordered under an open-end credit plan (as defined in the federal Truth-in-Lending law) or under any other credit plan which was opened prior to the mail order in question and which permits the consumer to make future purchases; or

   (2) items, such as quarterly magazines, which by their nature are not produced until a future date, and so cannot be stocked at the time of the order; or

   (3) installments, other than the first, of items ordered for serial delivery, such as magazine subscriptions. The 30-day period of 6 RCNY § 5-48(a) does not apply when all advertising for the item conspicuously specifies a different time period by which delivery may be expected. One week after this specified time elapses, the requirements of 6 RCNY § 5-48(a) must be met.

(c) Repairs made outside the home.

   (1) Requirements upon taking possession.

      (i) A repairer who takes possession of a consumer's property must immediately give the consumer a receipt and a written estimate. The receipt must contain:

      (ii) The written estimate must be as described in the preceding paragraph (1) of this subdivision (c).

If this is the case, the repairer may begin work after:

         (A) giving the consumer an oral estimate of the cost of repairs; and

         (B) getting the consumer's oral authorization to proceed; and

For parts in any of the following categories, the repairer may simply show and offer them to the consumer:

         (A) parts too large to be easily moved;

         (B) parts which must be returned to the manufacturer if the consumer wishes to take advantage of a warranty; and

         (C) parts which the repairer buys from the consumer to rebuild.

The estimate must include parts, labor and all other charges which the consumer will have to pay.

   (2) The repairer must give the consumer a written final bill that itemizes all charges, in the manner prescribed in 6 RCNY § 5-54(c)(2)(v), and discloses the legal name of the repairer in accordance with 6 RCNY § 5-01 "Legal Name".

("Represent" means to appear before any government tax administering authority as attorney, Certified Public Accountant or enrolled agent. Failure to make this disclosure shall mean that the tax preparer, if lawfully authorized, agrees to represent the taxpayer or to provide representation.)

   (2) The price list sign required by subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall also be posted prominently and conspicuously at each point at which orders are placed and/or payment is made, including at each counter or desk, except where a tax preparer is doing business at a consumer’s home or business, in which case the tax preparer must give each consumer a hard copy of the price list prior to any discussion with the consumer. Compliance by a tax preparer with this requirement shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of § 20-750(a) of the Administrative Code and 6 RCNY § 5-70(a).

   (3) Tax preparers must:

      (i) sign every tax return prepared;

      (ii) give a copy of every tax return prepared to the taxpayer, at the time the original tax return is given to the taxpayer for filing;

      (iii) provide the taxpayer with a statement of the charges for each tax return or schedule prepared;

      (iv) return any of the taxpayer's personal papers upon request, when the original tax return is given to the taxpayer for filing, unless specifically permitted to retain such papers under State law.

(d) Refunds. Tax preparers may not:

   (1) guarantee a tax refund, or guarantee that the taxpayer will not be audited by any government tax agency;

   (2) request a taxpayer to assign to the preparer any portion of the refund due;

   (3) use their addresses on a tax return as the place to which a refund should be mailed, unless the taxpayer has signed a power of attorney containing such authorization. A fiduciary with authority to handle a taxpayer's financial matters is not required to obtain this power of attorney;

   (4) claim to give taxpayers an "instant tax refund" that is actually an interest-bearing loan unless that fact is disclosed to the taxpayer in accordance with Federal and State law.

(e) Records. Each tax preparer shall retain a copy of every tax return prepared for a period of at least three years from the preparation date or the due date of the return, whichever is later.

(f) Disclosure in foreign languages.

   (1) In addition to English, all disclosures required by this section must be made in any other language which the tax preparer uses to attract customers.

   (2) For purposes of this section, failure to post each separately enumerated notice requirement constitutes a separate violation for which a penalty will be assessed.

(g) Exemption. Any individual or business which prepares income tax returns as an adjunct service to year-round fiduciary activities provided in the regular course of business for its customers is exempt from this section. If the business also offers individual tax return preparation services which are not related to such fiduciary activities, this section applies to those services.

   Example: A bank trust department offers its services for a fee as trustee on personal trust accounts. The bank advertises that preparation of the beneficiaries' personal income tax returns is available to the beneficiaries of any trust for which it is trustee. This section does not apply to this tax preparation service. If, however, the bank has an agreement with a tax preparation service, under which the service would supply tax preparation services to the public at various branches of the bank, the bank is subject to this section. If the bank provides the service by its own employees, it is subject to this section.

(a) A "weight loss provider" is defined as any person or business entity who or which is primarily engaged in the business of offering services to consumers to assist them in losing weight.

   (1) WARNING: Rapid weight loss may cause serious health problems. (Rapid weight loss is weight loss of more than 1 1/2 pounds to 2 pounds per week or weight loss of more than 1% of body weight per week after the second week of participation in a weight loss program.)

The term "debt" means any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money, property, insurance, or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment.

Debt collection procedures. The term "debt collection procedures" means any attempt by a debt collector to collect a debt after:

   (1) with respect to accounts for which creditors are required to send periodic statements, the creditor has ceased sending those statements, or taken or threatened to take legal action against the consumer;

*§ 5-77 Unconscionable and Deceptive Trade Practices.*


It is an unconscionable and deceptive trade practice for a debt collector to attempt to collect a debt owed, due, or asserted to be owed or due except in accordance with the following rules:

(a) Acquisition of location information. Any debt collector communicating with any person other than the consumer for the purpose of acquiring location information about the consumer in order to collect a debt, after the institution of debt collection procedures shall:

   (1) identify himself or herself, state that he or she is confirming or correcting location information about the consumer and identify his or her employer when that identification connotes debt collection only if expressly requested;

   (2) not state or imply that such consumer owes any debt;

   (3) not communicate more than once, unless requested to do so by such person or unless the debt collector reasonably believes that the earlier response of such person is erroneous or incomplete and that such person now has correct or complete location information; for the purposes of this paragraph (3), the debt collector need not count as a communication returned unopened mail or a message left with a party other than the person the debt collector is attempting to reach in order to acquire location information about the consumer, as long as the message is limited to a telephone number, the name of the debt collector and a request that the person sought telephone the debt collector;

   (4) not use any language or symbol on any envelope or in the contents of any communication effected by the mails or telegram that indicates that the debt collector is in the debt collection business or that the communication relates to the collection of a debt; provided that a debt collector may use his or her business name or the name of a department within his or her organization as long as any name used does not connote debt collection; and

   (5) if the debt collector knows the consumer is represented by an attorney with regard to the subject debt and if the debt collector has knowledge of the attorney's name and address or can readily ascertain such attorney's name and address, not communicate with any person other than that attorney for the purpose of acquiring location information about the consumer unless the attorney fails to provide the consumer's location within a reasonable period of time after a request for the consumer's location from the debt collector and:

      (i) informs the debt collector that he or she is not authorized to accept process for the consumer; or

      (ii) fails to respond to the debt collector's inquiry about the attorney's authority to accept process within a reasonable period of time after the inquiry. The employer of a debt collector may not be held liable in any action brought under 6 RCNY § 5-77(a)(3) or (5) if the employer shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted despite the maintenance or procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such violation.

(b) Communication in connection with debt collection. A debt collector, in connection with the collection of a debt, shall not:

   (1) After institution of debt collection procedures, without the prior written consent of the consumer given directly to the debt collector after the institution of debt collection procedures, or without permission of a court of competent jurisdiction, communicate with the consumer in connection with the collection of any debt;

      (i) at any unusual time or place known, or which should be known, to be inconvenient to the consumer. In the absence of knowledge of circumstances to the contrary, a debt collector shall assume that the convenient time for communicating with a consumer is after 8 o'clock ante meridian and before 9 o'clock post meridian time at the consumer's location;

      (ii) if the debt collector knows the consumer is represented by an attorney with respect to such debt and if the debt collector has knowledge of the attorney's name and address or can readily ascertain such attorney's name and address, unless the attorney fails to respond within a reasonable period of time to a communication from the debt collector or unless the attorney consents to direct communication with the consumer, except any communication which is required by law or chosen from among alternatives of which one is required by law is not hereby prohibited;

      (iii) at the consumer's place of employment if the debt collector knows or has reason to know that the consumer's employer or supervisor prohibits the consumer from receiving such a communication; or

      (iv) with excessive frequency. In the absence of knowledge of circumstances to the contrary, a debt collector shall assume that more than twice during a seven-calendar-day period is excessively frequent. In making its calculation, the debt collector need not include any communication between a consumer and the debt collector which is in response to an oral or written communication from the consumer, or returned unopened mail, or a message left with a party other than one who is responsible for the debt as long as the message is limited to a telephone number, the name of the debt collector and a request that one who is responsible for the debt telephone the debt collector; or any communication which is required by law or chosen from among alternatives of which one is required by law. The employer of a debt collector may not be held liable in any action brought under 6 RCNY § 5-77(b)(1)(ii)-(iv) if the employer shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted despite maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such violation.

   (2) In order to collect a debt, and except as provided by 6 RCNY § 5-77(a), communicate with any person other than the consumer, his or her attorney, a consumer reporting agency if otherwise permitted by law, the creditor, the attorney of the creditor, a debt collector to whom or to whose employer the debt has been assigned for collection, a creditor who assigned the debt for collection, the attorney of that debt collector, or the attorney for that debt collector's employer, without the prior written consent of the consumer given directly to the debt collector after the institution of debt collection procedures, or without the prior written consent of the consumer's attorney or without the express permission of a court of competent jurisdiction, or as reasonably necessary to effectuate a postjudgment judicial remedy.

   (3) Communicate with any person other than the consumer's attorney, a consumer reporting agency if otherwise permitted by law, the creditor, the attorney of the creditor, a debt collector to whom or to whose employer the debt has been assigned for collection, a creditor who assigned the debt for collection, or the attorney of that debt collector or the attorney for that debt collector's employer in a manner which would violate any provision of this part if such person were a consumer.

   (4) After institution of debt collection procedures, communicate with a consumer with respect to a debt if the consumer has notified the debt collector in writing that the consumer wishes the debt collector to cease further communication with the consumer with respect to that debt, except that any communication which is required by law or chosen from among alternatives of which one is required by law is not hereby prohibited. The debt collector shall have a reasonable period of time following receipt by the debt collector of the notification to comply with a consumer's request, except that any debt collector who knows or has reason to know of the consumer's notification and who causes further communication shall have violated this provision. The debt collector may, however:

      (i) communicate with the consumer once in writing:

         (A) to advise the consumer that the debt collector's further efforts are being terminated or;

         (B) to notify the consumer that the debt collector or creditor may invoke specified remedies which are ordinarily invoked by such debt collector or;

         (C) where applicable, to notify the consumer that the debt collector or creditor intends to invoke a specific remedy if that is a remedy he is legally entitled to invoke and if he actually intends to invoke it; and

      (ii) respond to each subsequent oral or written communication from the consumer.

   (5) For the purpose of 6 RCNY § 5-77(b)(1)-(4), the term "consumer" includes the consumer's parent (if the consumer is a minor), guardian, executor, administrator, spouse (unless the debt collector knows or has reason to know that the consumer is legally separated from or no longer living with his or her spouse), or an individual authorized by the consumer to make purchases against the account which is the subject of the collection efforts. A request that the debt collector cease further communication, provided for under 6 RCNY § 5-77(b)(4), if made by the consumer's spouse or an individual authorized by the consumer to make purchases against the account, only affects the debt collector's ability to communicate further with the person making the request.

(c) Harassment or abuse. A debt collector, in connection with the collection of a debt, shall not engage in conduct the natural consequence of which is to harass, oppress or abuse any person in connection with a debt. Such conduct includes:

   (1) the use or threat of use of violence or other criminal means to harm the physical person, reputation, or property of any person;

   (2) the use of obscene or profane language or language the natural consequence of which is to abuse the hearer or reader;

   (3) the advertisement for sale of any debt to coerce payment of the debt;

   (4) causing a telephone to ring or engaging any person in telephone conversation repeatedly or continuously with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass any person at the called number;

   (5) the publication of a list of consumers who allegedly refuse to pay debts, except to another employee of the debt collector's employer or to a consumer reporting agency or to persons meeting the requirements of 15 U.S.C. § 1681a(f) or 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(3); or

   (6) except as provided by 6 RCNY § 5-77(a), the placement of telephone calls without meaningful disclosure of the caller's identity.

(d) False or misleading representations. A debt collector, in connection with the collection of a debt, shall not make any false, deceptive, or misleading representation. Such representations include:

   (1) the false representation or implication that the debt collector is vouched for, bonded by, or affiliated with the United States or any State, including the use of any badge, uniform or facsimile thereof;

   (2) the false representation or implication that any individual is an attorney or any communication is from an attorney;

   (3) the representation or implication that nonpayment of any debt will result in the arrest or imprisonment of any person or the seizure, garnishment, attachment, or sale of any property or wages of any person unless such action is lawful and the debt collector or creditor intends to pursue such action;

   (4) the threat to take any action that cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken;

   (5) the false representation or implication that a sale, referral, or other transfer of any interest in a debt shall cause the consumer to:

      (i) lose any claim or defense to payment of the debt; or

      (ii) become subject to any practice prohibited by this part;

   (6) the false representation of implication made in order to disgrace the consumer that the consumer committed any crime or other conduct;

   (7) the false representation or implication that accounts have been turned over to innocent purchasers for value;

   (8) the false representation or implication that documents are legal process;

   (9) the false representation or implication that documents are not legal process forms or do not require action by the consumer;

   (10) the false representation or implication that a debt collector operates or is employed by a consumer reporting agency as defined by 15 U.S.C. § 1681a(f);

   (11) the use of distribution of any written communication which simulates or is falsely represented to be a document authorized, issued, or approved by any court, official, or agency of the United States or any State, or which creates a false impression as to its source, authorization, or approval;

   (12) the use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer;

   (13) the use of any business, company, or organization name other than the true name of the debt collector's business, company, or organization, unless the general public knows the debt collector's business, company or organization by another name and to use the true name would be confusing;

   (14) after institution of debt collection procedures, the false representation of the character, amount or legal status of any debt, or any services rendered or compensation which may be lawfully received by any debt collector for the collection of a debt, except that the employer of a debt collector may not be held liable in any action brought under this provision if the employer shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was not intentional and occurred despite the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such violation;

   (15) except as otherwise provided under 6 RCNY § 5-77(a) and except for any communication which is required by law or chosen from among alternatives of which one is required by law, the failure to disclose clearly in all communications made to collect a debt or to obtain information about a consumer, that the debt collector is attempting to collect a debt and that any information obtained will be used for that purpose;

   (16) the use of any name that is not the debt collector's actual name; provided that a debt collector may use a name other than his actual name if he or she uses only that name in communications with respect to a debt and if the debt collector's employer has the name on file so that the true identity of the debt collector can be ascertained; or

   (17) any conduct proscribed by New York General Business Law §§ 601(1), (3), (5), (7), (8), or (9).

(e) Unfair practices. A debt collector may not use any unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect a debt. Such conduct includes:

   (1) the collection of any amount (including any interest, fee, charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation) unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law;

   (2) the solicitation or use by a debt collector of any postdated check or other postdated payment instrument for the purpose of threatening or instituting criminal prosecution;

   (3) causing charges to be made to any person for communications by misrepresentation of the true purpose of the communication. Such charges include collect telephone calls and telegram fees;

   (4) taking or threatening to take any nonjudicial action to effect dispossession or disablement of property if:

      (i) there is no present right to possession of the property claimed as collateral;

      (ii) there is no present intention to take possession of the property; or

      (iii) the property is exempt by law from such dispossession or disablement;

   (5) after institution of debt collection procedures, when communicating with a consumer by use of the mails or telegram, using any language or symbol other than the debt collector's address on any envelope, or using any language or symbol that indicates the debt collector is in the debt collection business or that the communication relates to the collection of a debt on a postcard, except that a debt collector may use his or her business name or the name of a department within his or her organization as long as any name used does not connote debt collection;

   (6) after institution of debt collection procedures, communicating with a consumer regarding a debt without identifying himself or herself and his or her employer or communicating in writing with a consumer regarding a debt without identifying himself or herself by name and address and in accordance with 6 RCNY § 5-77(e)(5); or

   (7) after institution of debt collection procedures, if a consumer owes multiple debts of which any one or portion of one is disputed, and the consumer makes a single payment with respect to such debts:

      (i) applying a payment to a disputed portion of any debt; or

      (ii) unless otherwise provided by law or contract, failing to apply such payments in accordance with the consumer's instructions accompanying payment. If payment is made by mail, the consumer's instructions must be written. Any communication by a creditor made pursuant to 6 RCNY § 5-77(e)(7)(ii) shall not be deemed communication for the purpose of 6 RCNY § 5-77(b)(1)(iv). The employer of a debt collector may not be held liable in any action brought under 6 RCNY § 5-77(e)(7) if the employer shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted despite maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such violation; or

   (8) engaging in any conduct prohibited by New York General Business Law §§ 601(2) or (4).

(f) Validation of debts.

   (1) Upon acceleration of the unpaid balance of the debt or demand for the full balance due, the following validation procedures shall be followed by debt collectors who are creditors or who are employed by creditors as defined by 15 U.S.C. § 1602(f) [Truth in Lending Act]; but who are not required to comply with 15 U.S.C. § 1637(a)(8) [;Fair Credit Billing Act];, and who do not provide consumers with an opportunity to dispute the debt which is substantially the same as that outlined in 15 U.S.C. § 1637(a)(8) and regulations promulgated thereunder: Within five days of any further attempt by the creditor itself to collect the debt, it shall send the customer a written notice containing:

      (i) the amount of the debt;

      (ii) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed valid by the debt collector;

      (iii) a statement that, if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period at the address designated by the debt collector in the notice, that the debt, or any portion thereof is disputed, the debt collector shall either:

         (A) make appropriate corrections in the account and transmit to the consumer notification of such corrections and an explanation of any change and, if the consumer so requests, copies of documentary evidence of the consumer's indebtedness; or

         (B) send a written explanation or clarification to the consumer, after having conducted an investigation, setting forth to the extent applicable the reason why the creditor believes the account of the consumer was correctly shown in the written notice required by 6 RCNY § 5-77(f)(1) and, upon the consumer's request, provide copies of documentary evidence of the consumer's indebtedness. In the case of a billing error where the consumer alleges that the creditor's billing statement reflects goods not delivered in accordance with the agreement made at the time of the transaction, a creditor may not construe such amount to be correctly shown unless it determines that such goods were actually delivered, mailed, or otherwise sent to the consumer and provides the consumer with a statement of such determination.

      (iv) if the debt collector is not the original creditor, a statement that, upon the consumer's written request within the thirty-day period, sent to the address designated by the debt collector in the notice, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor;

      (v) an address to which the consumer should send any writing which disputes the validity of the debt or any portion thereof or any writing requesting the name and address of the original creditor.

   (2) Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector who is not a creditor and not employed by a creditor shall, unless the following information is contained in an initial written communication, or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing:

      (i) the amount of the debt;

      (ii) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed;

      (iii) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector;

      (iv) a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period at the address designated by the debt collector in the notice that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector;

      (v) a statement that, upon the consumer's written request within the thirty-day period sent to the address designated by the debt collector in the notice, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor; and

      (vi) an address to which the consumer should send any writing which disputes the validity of the debt or any portion thereof or any writing requesting the name and address of the original creditor.

   (3) If, pursuant to 6 RCNY §§ 5-77(f)(1) or 5-77(f)(2) of this Regulation the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor, the debt collector shall not attempt to collect the amount in dispute until the debt collector obtains and mails to the consumer verification of the debt or a copy of the judgment or the name and address of the original creditor. The debt collector shall maintain for one year from the date the notice was mailed, records containing documentation of the date such notice was mailed, the date the response, if any, was received and any action taken following such response.

   (4) The failure of a consumer to dispute the validity of a debt under 6 RCNY § 5-77(f) shall not be construed by any court as an admission of liability by the consumer.

(g) Liability. The employer of a debt collector is liable for the debt collector's violation of 6 RCNY § 5-77. A debt collector who is employed by another to collect or attempt to collect debts shall not be held liable for violation of 6 RCNY § 5-77.






*§ 5-78 Deceptive Forms.*


It is a deceptive and unconscionable trade practice for any person to design, compile and furnish any form knowing that such form would be used to create the false belief in a consumer that a person other than the creditor of such consumer is participating in the collection of or in an attempt to collect a debt such consumer allegedly owes such creditor, when in fact such person is not so participating.






*§ 5-79 Severability.*


If any provision of this part or the application of such provision to any person or circumstances shall be held unconstitutional or invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of the part and the applicability of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.






*§ 5-80 Citation Form.*


This part may be cited as Consumer Protection Law Regulations Part 6.






*§ 5-86 Definitions.*


Advertiser. Where the "advertiser" is a chain store, the requirements of this part shall apply to each branch as if it were a separate store.

Advertiser's bona fide selling price. "Advertiser's bona fide selling price" shall mean the immediately preceding price at which the same item or service was actually offered for sale to the public by the advertiser for a reasonably substantial period of time in the recent regular course of the advertiser's business, unless an earlier time period is clearly specified, and not a price charged for the purpose of establishing a fictitious higher price on which a deceptive comparison might be based.

(1) "Recent regular course of business" shall mean the current selling season on seasonal goods; or, on services or non-seasonal goods, the period of the current model or twelve months, whichever is shorter.

(2) It is prima facie evidence that a selling price for a service or an item is bona fide if:

   (i) the item was offered for a reasonably substantial period of time and a substantial quantity of sales were made at that price, or

   (ii) if a substantial number of sales was not made at such price, that the item was openly offered for sale to the public for a reasonably substantial period of time and that such offering price was reasonable based upon the manner in which such items were displayed or offered for sale, and such other factors as the mark-up reflected in such price and the price of comparable items.

Genuine. "Genuine," when used in this part with such phrases as "open stock price," "list price," "suggested retail price," and "catalog price" shall mean that the price is one at which substantial quantities of the identical merchandise have actually been sold to the public within the recent regular course of business, by the advertiser or principal retail outlets within the New York City trading area, or, if identical merchandise is not available in the New York City trading area, in principal retail outlets in other similar trading areas provided that the fact is disclosed. During the first two weeks after a new model or item has been introduced, a "list price," "suggested retail price" or "catalog price" may be considered "genuine" only if:

(1) the list price, suggested retail price or catalog price for the last previous model was genuine, or,

(2) where no previous model existed, the list price, suggested retail price or catalog price for other similar goods, produced by the same manufacturer and sold in the preceding selling season or twelve month period, was genuine. Where no previous model or similar goods existed or where the manufacturer has not previously made use of list price or suggested retail price, the list price, suggested retail price or catalog price may be used for up to thirty days after introduction of the new model or item after which time, the advertiser must be able to demonstrate that the price is genuine.

In-store. "In-store" representation shall mean any written statement, visual description, advertisement, or other written representation of any kind, or any oral statement by a demonstrator which is made inside the interior premises of the merchant.

Models and types. "Models" and "types" refer to models and types exclusive of differentiations attributable only to sizes or colors except where sizes or colors are material, e.g. mattresses, paint.

Out-of-store. "Out-of-store" representations shall mean any oral or written statement, visual description, advertisement or other representation of any kind made outside the interior premises of the advertiser, including representations made in newspapers, magazines, handbills, billboards, direct mailings, on radio and television and in store windows, storefronts, and other similar places where the representations can be perceived by the public not yet inside the premises of the merchant.

Retail market price. "Retail market price" shall mean:

(1) the price at which substantial sales of the same article or service are presently being made in principal retail outlets in the New York City trading area, or

(2) where no substantial sales have been made, the bona fide, usual and customary selling price of the item or service as offered in principal retail outlets in the New York City trading area.






*§ 5-87 Prohibited Conduct.*


It is a deceptive practice in the sale or offering for sale of consumer goods or services for a person (including any business entity) having a store, place of business for sales or mailing address for sales in the City of New York, or otherwise selling in the City of New York to advertise or represent in connection with sales made in the City of New York or offerings for sales to be made in the City of New York that such goods or services are being or will be offered or sold to New York City consumers at a reduction, discount, or savings in a manner in violation of this part.






*§ 5-88 Identification of Merchandise and Services (Out-of-Store Representations).*


An out-of-store representation or advertisement containing words or numbers indicating a savings, reduction, discount or sale price, must include limiting language which permits the consumer to identify the merchandise or services being offered at savings, reductions, discounts or sale price. Identification simply by former price is not sufficient unless the items so identified constitute a percentage of the advertised brands, styles, types, models, classes, or categories of merchandise or services sufficiently large to meet reasonable consumer expectations created by the advertisement.

(a) Such limiting language should be sufficiently precise to permit consumers to distinguish the applicable merchandise or services. This can be accomplished only by setting forth the brand, price, style, type, model, class or category, as appropriate in the context of the out-of-store representation or advertisement. Vague language such as "percentage off some merchandise" does not comply with this requirement. An advertisement shall be construed to apply to every piece of merchandise (or every service) within that category, type, make, model, (etc.).

Examples: 

   (1) "Brand X aluminum tennis rackets." Acceptable. 

   (2) "Steel belted radial tires." Acceptable if all steel belted radial tires are now on sale. 

   (3) "Famous manufacturer's single lens reflex cameras." Acceptable if all of the particular manufacturer's single lens reflex cameras are on sale. 

   (4) "Men's cashmere sweaters, formerly $40, now $30." This is acceptable if all men's cashmere sweaters that were formerly $40 are now on sale, and these sweaters constitute a percentage of the store's total supply of cashmere sweaters sufficiently large to meet reason able consumer expectations created by the advertisement. 

(b) (1) If the merchandise or services referred to in the out-of-store representation or advertisement as being offered at a savings, reduction, discount or sale price cannot be specified with precision because the sale involves:

      (i) less than all of the brands, styles, types, models, classes or categories of merchandise or services identified;

      (ii) a storewide sale in a broad cross-section of departments; or

      (iii) one or more established departments, but less than all of the merchandise or services in such departments, the terms "selected," "many," "representative," "assorted," or terms of similar import, may be used as limiting language to comply with identification requirement of this section, provided that a meaningful percentage of such merchandise or services is so offered. "Meaningful percentage" shall mean an amount of merchandise that will meet reasonable consumer expectations created by the advertisement. For 5 RCNY § 5-88(b)(1)(i), it shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of the meaningful percentage requirement if at least 15 percent of such brands, styles, types, models, classes or categories identified are not on sale, provided however, that the advertiser shall be permitted to show that under the particular circumstances involved the amount on sale was not deceptive.

   (2) In the absence of words of limitation, an advertisement shall be construed to apply to every piece of merchandise or every service within that category, type, make, model, etc.

   Examples: 

      (i) "Numerous pottery vases" complies if at least 15 percent of the pottery vases are on sale, unless the advertiser can demonstrate that under the particular circumstances involved the amount on sale, in light of the advertisement itself, is not deceptive.

      (ii) "Assistant Managers' birthday sale – storewide savings on selected merchandise" complies if the amount of merchandise on sale meets reasonable consumer expectations created by the advertisement.

      (iii) "Representative low-cut tennis sneakers" complies provided 15 per cent of the types of brands, makes or etc., are on sale, unless the advertiser can demonstrate that under the particular circumstances involved the amount on sale in light of the advertisement itself was not deceptive.

      (iv) "Special grouping of Misses' slacks, regularly $20 now $15" complies if at least 15 percent of all Misses' slacks regularly $20 are now $15 unless the advertiser can demonstrate that under the particular circumstances involved the amount on sale, in light of the advertisement itself, was not deceptive.

      (v) "Reduction on many items in the Sporting Goods and Luggage Department" complies if the amount of merchandise on sale in each department meets reasonable consumer expectations created by the advertisement.

(c) An out-of-store representation or advertisement concerning a storewide sale or a sale in a broad cross-section of departments which displays, pictures, or mentions specific items which are on sale must also disclose whether the items displayed, pictured or mentioned are the only ones on sale. If they are not the only ones on sale, the advertisement must disclose the extent to which items not displayed, pictured or mentioned are on sale.

Example: "Semi-annual White Sale – These and many other savings" complies if the complete supply of all pictured items is on sale and a meaningful percentage of the ether sale items is offered at a savings. 






*§ 5-89 "Wholesale Price," "Manufacturer's Price," "Factory Price," and Similar Terms.*


If an advertiser states or implies that goods are offered at or below "list," "wholesale," "wholesale price," "original wholesale," or other similar terms, these terms must pertain to the price currently and generally paid for such goods by retailers in the New York City trading area. If the advertiser states or implies that goods are offered at or below "manufacturer's wholesale," "manufacturer's price," "factory price," or other similar terms indicating purchase directly from a manufacturer, these terms must pertain to the price currently and generally paid for such goods by retailers in the New York City trading area who purchase the category of merchandise directly from the manufacturer. It is presumptive evidence of compliance with this section if the advertiser can show that the goods are offered below the price paid by the advertiser.






*§ 5-90 "Less Than Cost," "At a Loss," and Similar Terms.*


If the advertiser uses the words:

"less than cost" "at a loss" "below retailer's cost"

or other similar terms implying that the purchaser is paying a lower price than the advertiser, the price to the consumer must actually be less than the price paid by the advertiser.






*§ 5-91 Reductions Based on Advertiser's Own Price; "Formerly," "Regularly," "Reduced," "Percent Off," "Save," and Similar Terms.*


(a) Immediately preceding price. If an advertiser uses the words:

   "percent off" "formerly ..., now ..." "reduced" "reduced to" "regularly..., now ..." "now only" "save $ ..." "was ..., now ..., "item now $ ..."

   or any similar term implying a reduction from a prior price charged by the advertiser, the price to which the reduced offering price is being compared must be the advertiser's bona fide selling price for that item or service unless the advertiser clearly discloses another basis of comparison or qualification.

(b) Intermediate reductions. If the term "originally," or any similar term, is used in any advertisement, the price stated as the "original" price must be the advertiser's bona fide selling price for the same article or service prior to intermediate reductions, and the price immediately prior to the current reduction must be disclosed, unless intermediate reductions are clearly indicated by the language used.

   Example: "Originally $75; then $68; now $65" "Earlier this year $75; now $65" "Further reduced to $50." 

(c) Comparison not recent. If a claim is based on a past bona fide selling price of the advertiser prior to the recent, regular course of business, the advertiser must clearly disclose that fact.

   Example: "Last year $40, now $20." 






*§ 5-92 Comparisons Based on Price of Identical Merchandise or Services Sold Elsewhere: "Value," "Nationally Advertised at," "Usually," "List," and Similar Terms.*


(a) "Value," "nationally advertised at," "sold nationally at," "made to sell for," "woven to sell for," "usually." If the terms:

   "value" "nationally advertised at" "sold nationally at" "made to sell for" "woven to sell for" "elsewhere"

   or other similar terms implying a generally accepted value or price are used with regard to any item or service, then the price to which the reduced offering price is being compared must be the retail market price of the item or service. Furthermore, the terms "value," "nationally advertised at," or "sold nationally at" or any similar terms implying a generally accepted value or price in a national market may be used only

   (1) in relation to articles or services whose prices have been nationally advertised to the consuming public and

   (2) i) in relation to prices which are retail market prices, or,

      (ii) if the advertised item or service is not available elsewhere in the New York City trading area, the prices for which the article or service is currently selling in principal retail outlets in a substantial number of other representative communities in the United States.

(b) If the term "usually" is used with regard to any item or service, then the price to which the reduced offering price is being compared must be either

   (1) the advertiser's own bona fide price for the item or service, or

   (2) the retail market price.

(c) "list," "catalog," "suggested," "manufacturer's suggested," prices. Any "list" price, "catalog" price, "suggested" price, "manufacturer's suggested" price, "retailer's suggested" price or a preticketed price displayed by the advertiser must be genuine, unless, in the case of a price printed by a supplier of the advertiser, the advertiser has made every reasonable effort to remove or obliterate totally the printed price, or if removal or obliteration is impracticable taking into account the cost thereof, has conspicuously disclaimed that it is genuine. The display of any list price or printed price accompanied by a lower price constitutes a representation that such price is genuine and that the merchandise is being offered at a discount from such genuine price unless in the case of a price printed by a supplier of the advertiser, the advertiser has made every reasonable effort to remove or obliterate totally the printed price, or if removal or obliteration is impracticable taking into account the cost thereof, has conspicuously disclaimed that it is genuine.






*§ 5-93 Claims Based on Price of Comparable Merchandise or Services:"Comparable Value" and Similar Terms.*


If the term:

"comparable value" "compare with" "equal to"

or other similar term implying comparison with non-identical merchandise is used

(a) the advertisement must not imply that the comparison is with the former or usual price of the advertised merchandise or service itself; and

(b) the compared merchandise or service must be of essentially similar quality in those material respects which affect consumer preferences and marketability; and

(c) the price to which the advertiser's price is compared must be the retail market price or the genuine list, suggested or catalog price of the comparable article or service; and

(d) the comparable article or service must be generally available in New York City at the price stated; and

(e) the advertisement must clearly and conspicuously disclose that "comparable value" pertains to similar but not identical merchandise or services. If an aggregate "open stock" price is used as a comparative price for an advertised set, the advertisement must disclose this fact and indicate that the advertised saving is based upon the difference between the price for the set and the total open stock price for items comprising the set.






*§ 5-94 Range Discounts: "% to % Off," "Up to % Off Selected" and Similar Terms.*


(a) If an advertiser uses terms such as:

   "Savings of ____ % to ____ %" "____ % to ____ % off"

   or other similar terms to indicate a price range, then:

   (1) the minimum percentage reduction must be stated as conspicuously as the maximum percentage reduction; and

   (2) the price from which the discount or reduction is taken must be either a genuine list, suggested or catalog price, the retail market price or the advertiser's bona fide selling price, for the same articles or services, unless another basis is clearly stated; and

   (3) "out-of-store" advertisements must disclose which of the above standards was or were used (if a single advertisement relates to merchandise or services offered at reductions according to different standards, it must disclose which standards apply to which types of merchandise or services);

      Example: "____ % to ____ % off the manufacturer's price" "____ % to ____ % off last year's price." 

   (4) at least 15 percent of all types, models, or categories of items or services on sale in the advertised category must in fact be reduced by the maximum percentage reduction and a representative number of other models or types or services must be offered at various points in the range significantly separated and representatively scattered.

      Example: "PORTABLE RADIOS AND TELEVISIONS 10%-50% off our former prices" 

      Complies if at least 15 percent of all models of portable radios and televisions available are selling at 50 percent off, and a representative number of the remaining models are offered at various points between 10 and 50 percent representatively scattered throughout that range.

(b) If the terms:

   "discounts from ..... %" "up to ...... % off" "as high as" "save up to ..... %"

   or other similar terms are used to advertise a range of reductions with no specified minimum reduction,

   (1) the prices used for comparison must be the advertiser's bona fide selling price, the retail market price, or a genuine list, suggested price for the same articles or services, unless another basis or a qualification is clearly stated;

   (2) "out-of-store" advertisements must disclose which of the above standards was or were used;

   (3) at least 15 percent of all the types, models, or services on sale in the advertised categories must be offered for sale at the stated maximum percentage reduction; and

   (4) a representative number of the remaining models or types or services must be offered at various points representatively scattered throughout the range from the stated maximum percentage reduction to the bottom of the range, or the majority of such other models or types or services must be offered at points in the higher portion of the range.

      Example: "BRAND Y CASSETTE TAPE RECORDERS" "Up to 30 percent off" 

      Complies if at least 15 percent of all models of Brand Y Cassette tape recorders available are selling at 30 percent off and the remaining models are offered at various points representatively scattered throughout the range below 30 percent or the majority of the remaining models are offered at points in the higher portion of the range. If the range is 0-30 percent, the majority of the remaining models would have to be offered above 15 percent; if the range is 10-30 percent, the majority would have to be offered above 20 percent.

(c) If terms such as "formerly $ ..... to $ .....; now $ ....." are used, the maximum price in the range of advertised former prices must represent the advertiser's bona fide selling price for at least 15 percent of all the types, models or services advertised. Bona fide selling prices for the other items or services must have been at levels representatively scattered through the range of advertised former prices.






*§ 5-95 "Advance Sale" or "Introductory Offer."*


(a) If an advertiser uses the words "advance sale" or "introductory offer" or statements such as "if there are any left they will be marked $ .....," or any other words or statements implying that the goods or services are offered for sale at a reduced price in relation to a future mark-up, he must also

   (1) have, in fact, in the case of goods, either a reasonable quantity of merchandise in stock, or an order to be marked up; or demonstrate his intention to order such merchandise for future mark-up; and

   (2) mark up the goods or services within a reasonable period of time and maintain the mark-up for a reasonable period of time not less than 30 days, unless he can show that competitive circumstances occurring subsequent to the advertisement required him to maintain or lower the price in order to maintain a competitive position.

(b) If the words "introductory offer" or words of similar meaning are used, they must pertain only to merchandise or services not previously sold by the advertiser nor sold by him for more than six weeks prior to the advertisement.






*§ 5-96 Combination Offers.*


(a) If the advertiser uses "combination offers," in which he offers his product in combination with one or more additional articles or services at a stated price, and claims that the combined articles or services have a "value" greater than the total advertised selling price of the individual items, the total "value" claimed must not be greater than the total of the retail market prices of the articles and services as sold separately.

(b) If none of the combination articles is being sold in the New York City trading area and the comparison is based on comparable merchandise, the phrase "comparable value" may be used only if it complies with 6 RCNY § 5-93.

(c) If one or more of the articles offered in combination is in general retail distribution, but one or more is not, comparative prices for the articles may be stated separately, according to the facts.






*§ 5-97 "Discount," "Outlet," "Bargain" and "Warehouse" Operations.*


If a retailer includes in the name of his store, or in any other "out-of-store" manner represents the regular retail operation of his entire store by use of the words "discount," "outlet," "bargain," "warehouse," or any other term implying that all goods and services are regularly sold at less than genuine list, catalog, suggested or retail market prices, then 75 percent of the retailer's dollar volume in the last selling season exclusive of fair-traded items must have been from items which were in fact sold for at least 5 percent less than genuine list, catalog, suggested or retail market price.






*§ 5-98 Discount Departments.*


A retailer may not use the words "discount," "bargain," "warehouse," "bargain basement," or other similar terms in characterizing a particular department or section within his regular retail operation unless

(a) a substantial percentage of the dollar volume of the last previous selling season within that department or section was derived from items sold for less than genuine list, catalogue, suggested or retail market prices. It shall be presumptive evidence of violation of this section if the advertiser cannot show that at least 35 percent of the dollar volume in the last previous selling season within that department or section was derived from items selling for less than genuine list, catalog, suggested or retail market prices for such items; or

(b) all items not presently being sold for at least 5 percent less than genuine catalog, list, suggested or retail market price, are clearly and conspicuously designated as non-discount items. This requirement of designation may be satisfied by segregation of identified non-discount items, shelf labels, or other prominent signs, a listing of non-discount items clearly and conspicuously displayed in the relevant department, or a standardized sticker or tag with a clear and conspicuous explanation that the item to which it is affixed is a non-discount item.

   Example: A shoe department in a retail store sells brands X, Y, and Z shoes. Brand X is sold at less than retail market price, and brands Y and Z are sold at retail market price. In the last previous selling season, 35 percent of all shoe sales came from the sale of brand X shoes. The store is in compliance with this article. But if less than 35 percent of all sales came from sales of brand X shoes, brands Y and Z must be conspicuously designated as nondiscount items in order for the department to be called "discount shoe department." 






*§ 5-99 Meaningful Reductions.*


All discounts, sales, reductions or savings must be meaningful, and not merely nominal or insignificant. All articles and services so advertised must be offered at a reduction or savings of at least 5 percent from the price to which the advertiser's is being compared, unless [in the case of items retailing for over $100] the advertisement clearly sets forth the actual percentage of reduction or the dollar amount of the reduction.






*§ 5-100 Sufficient Quantities.*


The retailer either must have in stock or on order, or be prepared to supply within a reasonable time sufficient quantities of each advertised item or service to fulfill reasonably anticipated public demand, or clearly conspicuously disclose in the advertisement any items or services of genuinely limited availability. A retailer is not "prepared to supply" merchandise unless he has communicated with suppliers and ascertained, prior to advertising, that the merchandise is available to him.






*§ 5-101 Inherently Misleading Terms.*


The following inherently misleading terms are prohibited in retail advertising: "our list price" below "manufacturer's wholesale cost" "manufacturer's cost"






*§ 5-102 Adequacy of Disclosure.*


All disclosures and words of limitation or qualification required by this part shall be written or printed in letters at least one third as high and one third as broad as the largest words or numbers appearing in the advertisement which relate to or describe the reduction, discount or savings, but in no event in less than ten point type. In radio announcements, the disclosure or words of limitation or qualification shall be clearly spoken, and in television announcements they shall be part of the radio track and not merely part of the picture.






*§ 5-103 Records Required.*


(a) Each person who advertises or represents the existence of a discount, reduction or savings shall for three months maintain records demonstrating compliance with this part at his principal place of business within the City of New York or at a location where such records are normally maintained by such person.

Example: An advertiser who advertises "20 percent off Brand X cameras" must maintain records demonstrating that the reduction is from the bona fide selling price. If the cameras were last sold at such lower price eleven months ago, the advertiser must retain the records indicating the earlier price. These records must be kept for a period of three months after the sale is over. 

(b) Where the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs or her delegate requests a person to produce by mail information or records to demonstrate compliance with this part, and the information, or original, carbon, photographic or electrostatic copies of the records are available in the company's files, the person shall mail a copy of such information to the person requesting it within seven business days after receipt of the request unless such time period is extended by the Chief of the Law Enforcement Division. Where the information is available to the person but not in his possession, or where the record must be reconstructed (e.g., where they have been stored in the memory bank of a computer), the person shall mail a copy of such information to the person requesting it within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed sixty business days, after receipt of the request unless such time period is extended by the Chief of the Law Enforcement Division. In lieu of mailing requested information or records to the Commissioner, a person may grant access to the files for purpose of examination and to copy documentary evidence by advising the Commissioner in writing within 5 business days after receipt of the request that such access will be granted provided the information or records are kept in New York City.

(c) No action shall be maintained by the Commissioner under Administrative Code, § 20-703(c) merely for failure to maintain or produce records required by this section. However, all of the other penalties provided by § 20-703 shall apply.






*§ 5-104 Regulations 6 RCNY §§ 5-06 and 5-12 Not Affected.*

*§ 5-115 Guidelines on Multiple Pricing.*


(a) Definitions. Whenever used in these guidelines, the following terms shall be deemed to mean and include:

   Commissioner. The Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs of the City of New York.

   Consumer Protection Law. New York City Local Law 83 of 1969, as the same has, or may hereafter be, amended.

   Department. The Department of Consumer Affairs of the City of New York.

   Identical items of merchandise. "Identical items of merchandise" shall " mean a single unit of merchandise available for purchase that is of the same brand and is the same as another unit of merchandise in every other way. For the purpose of these guidelines, items of merchandise that have different prices but have no other differences shall be deemed identical.

   Item of merchandise. "Item of merchandise" shall mean a single unit of merchandise available for purchase.

   Multiple pricing. "Multiple pricing" shall mean the practice of having identical items of merchandise, as above defined, available for sale at a particular time for more than one price. For purposes of these guidelines, a difference in price achieved by the use of discount coupons, quantity purchases or the like shall not be deemed an instance of multiple pricing.

   Retail food store. "Retail food store" shall mean a store which has as its principal line of business the sale at retail of a broad range of food items.

   Truth-In-Pricing Law. "Truth-In-Pricing Law" shall mean New York City Local Law 14 of 1971, as the same has, or may hereafter be, amended.

(b) Consumer Protection Law. It is the enforcement policy of the Department of Consumer Affairs in interpreting the Consumer Protection Law that Multiple Pricing is a deceptive trade practice except where each of the following conditions are complied with:

   (1) Applicability. The practice is maintained by a retail food store.

   (2) Information program. The terms of the Multiple Pricing program are communicated to the retail food store's employees who are to implement the program and those terms are also clearly explained to its customers m New York City. The means by which the program is explained to customers shall include the conspicuous posting of the terms of the retail food store's Multiple Pricing program which terms shall include a list of any items excluded from the operation of the Multiple Pricing program and, where applicable, any method of identifying the location of multiple priced merchandise. Each sign shall cover an area of not less than 18 inches by 18 inches and shall be printed in legible type in a manner that shall make it easily readable. There shall be at least one sign for each two thousand (2,000) square feet of selling area. One such sign shall be placed near each door through which consumers enter, in such a place and positioned in such a way as to be readily seen by a consumer upon entering. No retail food store shall be required to have more signs than the greater of:

      (i) the number of consumer entrances to such store, or

      (ii) five signs. In addition, a smaller sign shall be placed at each cash register clearly visible to the consumer advising the consumer of the store's program of Multiple Pricing. At least two (2) weeks prior to termination of Multiple Pricing, a retail store shall so notify its customers in New York City. Such notification shall include the conspicuous posting of signs indicating such intended termination in compliance with the second paragraph of this 6 RCNY § 5-115(b).

   (3) Retail food store internal operations.

      (i) Identical items of merchandise are not offered for sale at more than two prices, except that where a store has a policy of not remarking items marked for sale after the termination of the sale, identical items of merchandise may be offered for sale at three prices until the items that were marked for the sale are sold.

      (ii) Any item of merchandise sold in a retail food store that bears more than one price, shall be sold at the lowest price shown. Having more than one price visible on any item of merchandise is a violation of the regulations of the Department and selling such merchandise at the lowest price appearing on such merchandise shall not cure any such violation.

      (iii) Where an item of merchandise is offered for sale at a price based on a multiple purchase, as for example "2 cans for 35 cents," and an identical item of merchandise is offered for sale at a different price that is higher per item than the group price, or at a higher group price, a consumer who purchases the items of merchandise in the quantity necessary for the group price, shall be entitled to purchase said quantity at the lowest group price. By way of illustration, item X was originally priced at 2 cans for 40 cents, however the new cans of X placed on the shelf are priced at 21 cents each. A consumer purchasing 2 cans of X, one bearing the old markings and one the new would pay a total of 40 cents for the two cans.

      (iv) In any retail food store where Multiple Pricing is in effect all items sold shall be subject to it and the only products not multiply priced may be

         (A) items which prior to the initiation of the program were not individually marked with a price and price was disclosed by such means as a price sign at the point of sale,

         (B) items where the retailer cannot vary the price by the requirement of any law or regulation of any governmental authority or the requirements of any fair trade agreement, and

         (C) items for which the retailer has received the Department's prior approval to remove them from Multiple Pricing.

      (v) Multiple priced merchandise shall be placed in such a way that

         (A) lower priced items are grouped together and

         (B) lower priced items are placed nearest to the consumer. On a surface which is parallel to the store floor, such as shelf merchandise, such lower priced items will be placed towards the front edge of the shelf with higher priced items behind. Where items are stacked vertically, as in freezer cabinets, the lower priced items will be stacked on top of the higher priced items and grouped at the front of the vertical space allocated to such items. If any type of physical separation of multiple priced merchandise is instituted this must be applied uniformly throughout the store and must be disclosed on the store signs referred to in 6 RCNY § 5-115(b)(2) and also at each point of sale of the item. As an example, if items at a lower price are placed on a different shelf such sign shall be placed where the higher priced item is and where the lower priced item is.

      (vi) In all places where multiple priced items are offered for sale some clear identifying symbol shall be conspicuously displayed at the point of sale to indicate the availability of merchandise at a lower price. This requirement shall apply whether or not the retail food store is subject to the requirements of the Truth-In-Pricing Law. The symbol and the fact that the symbol designates the presence of lower priced merchandise shall be disclosed in the signs referred to in 6 RCNY § 5-115(b)(2).

   (4) Advertising.

      (i) The fact that any item may be available at a lower price shall not be advertised where such lower price is due to Multiple Pricing. Advertising material may contain a general statement concerning any Multiple Pricing policy in effect in any store or group of stores.

      (ii) When a sale is advertised the sale price shall be lower than the lowest price at which items of the merchandise are then available for sale in any quantity.

      (iii) Where, in advertising material, a potential savings to the consumer is described in such terms as "save 3 cents off regular price by purchasing X at 75 cents a can" the saving shown must be based on the lower price of the merchandise.

      (iv) All advertising material relating to Multiple Pricing shall contain a list of any items excluded from the operation of multiple pricing.

      (v) When retail food stores are subject to a common ownership, as in a chain, or though not commonly owned, participate in an advertising program under some common name covering more than one store, if one or more stores in the group is not utilizing Multiple Pricing, each store not using Multiple Pricing shall be specifically identified. Such statements as "... not available in certain stores" will not be permissible.

      (vi) If merchandise is available at a price lower than the advertised price, it shall be sold at the price shown on the item of merchandise. Having merchandise available for sale at a price lower than the sale price is a violation of 6 RCNY § 5-115(b)(4)(ii) hereof and selling such merchandise at such lower price shall not cure any such violation.

(c) Unit pricing. In stores subject to the requirement of the Truth-In-Pricing Law, unit pricing stickers will be prepared which indicate in all instances either

   (1) unit pricing data at each price at which an item is being sold, or

   (2) unit pricing information at the highest price that an item of merchandise is being sold and some method of clearly identifying at each place, where any merchandise is being sold at multiple prices that some of the same merchandise is available at a lower price. That method of disclosure shall be set out and explained in the signs referred to in 6 RCNY § 5-115(b)(2).

(d) Notification of the department. Any retail food store intending to use Multiple Pricing shall advise the Department in writing sent certified mail addressed to the Commissioner at 42 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10004. Such notice shall be mailed at least one (1) business day prior to initiating such program. Such notice shall be accompanied by copies of all instructions given to store employees concerning procedures which affect Multiple Pricing together with copies of any and all advertising materials discussing Multiple Pricing to be used by any retail food store or group of retail food stores. Retail food stores shall have the duty to notify the Commissioner when they intend to use any instructions or advertising materials not previously submitted to the Department. Notification of the Department pursuant to this paragraph shall not imply review of, or consent to the use of, such material by the Department. Any retail food store intending to terminate Multiple Pricing shall advise the Department in writing sent certified mail addressed to the Commissioner at 42 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10004. Such notice shall be mailed at least two (2) weeks prior to terminating such program.

(e) Powers of the Commissioner.

   (1) The Commissioner has the power to require such information as he or she may reasonably require to determine the ad];ministration and effect of any program of Multiple Pricing and such materials shall be supplied promptly and at no cost and expense to the Department of Consumer Affairs.

   (2) The Commissioner has the power to require additional steps to be taken by a retail food store to comply with the intent of these guidelines as she, in her discretion, may deem appropriate including the further publicizing of Multiple Pricing.

   (3) If these guidelines or directions of the Commissioner issued pursuant to these guidelines are not complied with after passage of sufficient time to allow for compliance, such failure shall be deemed a violation of the Consumer Protection Law or the Truth-In-Pricing Law, or both, as the case may be, and the Commissioner shall thereupon take such steps as shall be necessary to assure compliance or she may deny the retail food store the opportunity of operating a Multiple Pricing program. Each violation of a provision of these guidelines shall be treated as a separate violation under the appropriate law.

(f) Amendment. The Commissioner reserves the right at any time and from time to time to revise, amend, revoke or to otherwise modify or annul the effect of these guidelines.

(g) Other laws. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to interpret, waive or modify the requirements of any law, rule or regulation of the City of New York, the State of New York or the Federal Government other than the Consumer Protection Law and the Truth-In-Pricing Law.

*§ 5-269. Disclosures in Advertising.*


(a) "Advertisement promoting the services of a pregnancy services center" includes all promotional materials, statements, visual descriptions, or other visual representations of any kind disseminated in print or electronically, including, but not limited to, mailings, postcards, signs, business cards, flyers, hand-outs, brochures, banners, billboards, subway or bus signs, window signs, store-front signs, newspaper print advertisements and listings, telephone directory listings, television advertisements, internet advertisements, social media or social network sites and radio advertisements. "Advertisement promoting the services of a pregnancy services center" does not include communications or statements made by a center in the course of its operations that do not promote the center's services to clients or the general public, and that are directed exclusively to the center's non-client directors, employees, past financial donors, and interns.

(b) Every advertisement promoting the services of a pregnancy services center must include in English and Spanish the statement: "This facility does not have a licensed medical provider on site to provide or supervise all services." The lettering of such statements in printed materials must be clear, legible, and in the same color and darkness, and in a type size at least one-third as high and one-third as broad, as the largest print in the advertisement. The lettering of such statement in television and internet advertisements must be clear and legible and in close proximity to the description of services provided at the pregnancy services center. The lettering of such statement on business cards may be printed on the back of the cards.

(c) Every pregnancy services center must also post the statement provided in Subsection (b) of this Section on its website and social media or social network sites. The lettering of such statement must be clear, legible, in the same color and darkness, and in a type size at least one-third as high and one-third as broad, as the largest print on the website or on the social media or social network site. The statement must be posted on every page of the website and social media or social network site.

(d) In addition to the disclosure requirements provided in subsection (c), the statement provided in subsection (b) must be included in the text of each post made on a social media or social network site. In the event a social media or social network site, such as Twitter, limits the number of characters that may be used in a post, the statement may be attached as a photo image to each post rather than included in the text of each post. Where the statement is included in a photo image, the lettering of such statement shall be consistent with the requirements described in subsection (c). Where a post contains the description of services provided by such pregnancy services center, the statement must also be in close proximity to the services description. Each post that does not comply with this requirement shall constitute a single violation, except that for the purpose of imposing a sealing order pursuant to section 20-818(b)(1) of the administrative code, each day of noncompliance shall be treated as a separate occasion.








*§ 5-270. Oral Disclosure.*


Upon a client or prospective client request for an abortion, emergency contraception and/or prenatal care service, a pregnancy services center shall orally disclose in English and Spanish the statement: "This facility does not have a licensed medical provider on site to provide or supervise all services."








*§ 5-271. Evidence.*


(a) It shall be prima facie evidence that a facility has the appearance of a licensed medical facility if it has two or more of the factors listed in subparagraphs (a) through (f) of Title 20, Subchapter 17, Section 20-815(g)(2) of the New York City Administrative Code.

(b) A facility's distribution of a pregnancy test kit shall not, by itself, be sufficient to establish that it has the "appearance of a licensed medical facility," provided that the test is self-administered, self-diagnosed, and self-interpreted. Notwithstanding, a facility's distribution of a pregnancy test kit – even if the pregnancy test kit was exclusively self-administered, self-interpreted, and self-diagnosed – may be relied upon, in combination with another legally permissible factor, to establish the "appearance of a licensed medical facility."









**Subchapter Q: Bail Bond Agents**



*§ 5-272. Definitions.*


As used in this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:

Bail bond agent. The term “bail bond agent” has the same definition as that term is defined in Section 20-830 of the Administrative Code.

Designated citywide language. The term “designated citywide language” has the same definition as that term is defined in Section 20-830 of the Administrative Code.








*§ 5-273. Disclosures.*


(a) To comply with Section 20-831(b) of the Administrative Code, a bail bond agent must post in a conspicuous manner at its business and where transactions are executed a sign, produced and made available by the Department, no less than 8.5 inches by 11 inches in dimension that contains the following information:

(c) To comply with Section 20-831(c) of the Administrative Code, before entering into a contract with a consumer, a bail bond agent must produce and distribute to every consumer, the consumer bill of rights shown below on paper no less than 8.5 by 11 inches in dimension.

_______________________________________________________________________________________

Bail Bond Consumer Bill of Rights

By law, bail bond agents must give you a copy of this document before you sign a contract. It outlines your rights, how the process works, and maximum fees that a bail bond agent can charge. Take the time to read and understand it before you sign it. The bail bond agent must give you a copy of any signed document, including a contract, to keep.

Know Your Rights

It’s illegal for a bail bond agent to:

•   Charge a fee (also called a premium) for the bail bond that is more than the maximum fee allowed by law. See the Maximum Fees Chart. The fees charged by the bail bond agent are not refundable, which means you will not get back your money.

•   Charge extra for services if the charges, combined with other fees, exceed the maximum fees allowed. Services might have names like “courier fee” or “check-in fee.”

•   Require someone to pay more fees for a bail bond if the maximum fees have been paid already.

You have the right to:

•   Know the name and license number of the bail bond agent and receive this information in writing.

•   Negotiate the contract with the bail bond agent.

•   Take documents off the premises to review them before signing them.

•   Get a contract that tells you when the bail bond agent will return your collateral and under what conditions. Collateral can be cash, property, such as the deed to a home, or something with value that the bail bond agent keeps until a case is over. Collateral is refundable, so you get it back when the case is over. However, the bail bond agent may be able to keep the collateral if the defendant violates the court’s orders; for example, if the defendant does not show up for a scheduled court appearance.

•   Get back the collateral you provided if the judge decides that the defendant followed all of the court’s directions. It does not matter if the defendant is convicted or acquitted.

How the Process Works

Someone close to you is arrested and charged with a crime.

The court sets bail. If you cannot pay cash bail directly to the court, you can go to a bail bond agent to arrange a bail bond. Know your rights when using a bail bond agent! See Know Your Rights.

You pay the bail bond agent, possibly provide collateral, and sign a contract. The bail bond agent secures the bail bond.

The defendant is released from jail.

While the case is open, the defendant must obey all court orders and attend all scheduled court appearances. If not, the court may revoke bail, which means the bond is forfeited and you lose your collateral.

If the judge “exonerates” the bond (either at the end of the case or while the case is still open), then the bail bond agent must return the collateral. The court has exoneration paperwork, often called the “disposition,” which says whether the bail was exonerated, and you can take this to the bail bond agent as proof.

The bail bond agent either gives you the collateral immediately or mails it to you.

Maximum Fees Chart

The formula to determine the maximum fees that a bail bond agent can charge for a bail bond is:

•   If the bond is $200 or less, the maximum fee is $10.

•   If the bond is more than $200, the maximum fee is:

   o   10% of the amount up to $3,000

   o   An additional 8% for any amount between $3,000 and $10,000

   o   An additional 6% for any amount above $10,000

The maximum fees are set based on the size of the bond, not the number of people signing for it. If the maximum fee for a bond is $100 and two or more people sign for the bond, the bail bond agent may still only charge $100 total.

   (2) If an employee performs more than one job for the same employer or the employee's rate of pay fluctuates for a single job, the hourly rate of pay shall be the rate of pay that the employee would have been paid during the time that employee would have been performing work but for the employee's absence.

(b) Taking an adverse action includes, but is not limited to threatening, intimidating, disciplining, discharging, demoting, suspending, or harassing an employee, reducing the hours of pay of an employee, informing another employer than an employee has engaged in activities protected by the OLPS laws and rules, discriminating against the employee, including actions related to perceived immigration status or work authorization, and maintenance or application of an absence control policy that counts protected leave as an absence that may lead to or result in an adverse action.

(c) An employee need not explicitly refer to a provision of the OLPS laws and rules to be protected from an adverse action.

*§ 7-109 Enforcement and Penalties.*

(c) An employer shall respond to a written request for information or records by providing the Office with true, accurate, and contemporaneously-made records or information in a lesser amount of time than provided in paragraphs 2 and 3 of subdivision b of this section if agreed to by the parties or the Office has reason to believe that:

   (2) The employer is closing, selling, or transferring its business, disposing of assets or is about to declare bankruptcy;

   (3) The employer is the subject of a government investigation or enforcement action or proceeding related to wages and hours, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, discrimination, OLPS laws and rules, the Freelancers Law and rules, or the Transportation Benefits Law and rules; or

(d) In accordance with applicable law, the Office may resolve or attempt to resolve an investigation at any point through settlement upon terms that are satisfactory to the Office.

(e) The Office may issue a notice of violation to an employer who fails to provide true and accurate information or records requested by the Office in connection with an investigation.

(f) An employer who fails to timely and fully respond to the request for information or records that is the subject of a notice of violation issued under subdivision (e) of this section on or before the first scheduled appearance date is subject to a penalty of five hundred dollars, in addition to any penalties or remedies imposed as a result of the Office's investigation.

(g) The employer may cure a notice of violation issued in accordance with subdivision (e) of this section without the penalty imposed in connection with subdivision (f) by:

   (1) producing the requested information or records on or before the first scheduled appearance date; or

   (2) resolving, to the satisfaction of the Office on or before the first scheduled appearance date, the investigation that is the basis for the request for information or records.

(h) A finding that an employer has an official or unofficial policy or practice that denies a right established or protected by the OLPS laws and rules shall constitute a violation of the applicable provision of the OLPS laws and rules for each and every employee subject to such policy or practice.








*§ 7-110 Service.*


Service of documents issued by the Office to employers, including written requests for information or records and notices of violation, shall be made in a manner reasonably calculated to achieve actual notice to the employer. The following are presumed to be reasonably calculated to achieve actual notice: (i) personal service on the employer; (ii) personal service on the employer by regular first-class mail, certified mail, return receipt requested, or private mail delivery services, such as UPS, to an employer's last known business address; or (iii) if an employer has so consented, facsimile, email, including an attachment to an email.








*§ 7-111 Recordkeeping.*


(a) An employer's failure to maintain, retain, or produce a record that is required to be maintained under the OLPS laws and rules that is relevant to a material fact alleged by the Office in a notice of violation issued, pursuant to a provision of the OLPS laws and rules creates a reasonable inference that such fact is true, unless a rebuttable presumption or other adverse inference is provided by applicable law.

(b) An employer that produces records to the department or Office in response to a request for information affirms that the records produced are true and accurate.









**Subchapter B: Earned Safe and Sick Time**



*§ 7-201 Definitions.*


(a) As used in this chapter, the terms "calendar year," "employee," "employer," "health care provider," "paid safe/sick time," "safe time," and "sick time" shall have the same meanings as set forth in Section 20-912 of the Administrative Code.

(b) As used in the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act and in this subchapter, the term "domestic worker" means a person who provides care for a child, companionship for a sick, convalescing or elderly person, housekeeping, or any other domestic service in a home or residence whenever such person is directly and solely employed to provide such service by an individual or private household. The term "domestic worker" does not include any person who is employed by an agency whenever such person provides services as an employee of such agency, regardless of whether such person is jointly employed by an individual or private household in the provision of such services.








*§ 7-202 Business Size.*


(a) Business size for an employer that has operated for less than one year shall be determined by counting the number of employees performing work for an employer for compensation per week, provided that if the number of employees fluctuates between less than five employees and five or more employees per week, business size may be determined for the current calendar year based on the average number of employees per week who worked for compensation for each week during the 80 days immediately preceding the date the employee used safe time or sick time.

(b) Business size for an employer that has operated for one year or more is determined by counting the number of employees working for the employer per week at the time the employee uses safe time or sick time, unless the number of employees fluctuates, in which case business size may be determined for the current calendar year based on the average number of employees per week during the previous calendar year. For purposes of this section, "fluctuates" means that at least three times in the most recent calendar quarter the number of employees working for an employer fluctuated between less than five employees and five or more employees.








*§ 7-203 Employees.*


An individual is "employed for hire within the City of New York for more than eighty hours in a calendar year" for purposes of Section 20-912(f) of the Administrative Code if the individual performs work, including work performed by telecommuting, for more than eighty hours while the individual is physically located in New York City, regardless of where the employer is located.

i. Example: An individual who only performs work while physically located outside of New York City, even if the employer is based in New York City, is not "employed for hire within the City of New York" for purposes of Section 20-912(f) for hours worked outside New York City.

ii. Example: An individual performs twenty hours of work in New Jersey and sixty hours of work in New York City in a calendar year. The twenty hours of work performed by the employee in New Jersey do not count towards the employee's eighty hours of work for purposes of Section 20-912(f).








*§ 7-204 Minimum Increments and Fixed Intervals for the Use of Safe Time and Sick Time.*


(a) Unless otherwise in conflict with State or Federal law or regulations, an employee may decide how much earned safe time or sick time to use, provided however, that an employer may set a minimum increment for the use of safe time and sick time, not to exceed four hours per day, provided such minimum increment is reasonable under the circumstances.

   (i) Example: An employee has worked eighty hours and more than one hundred twenty calendar days have passed since the employee's first day of work for the employer. The employer has set a minimum increment of four hours per day for use of safe time and sick time. The employee has not yet accrued four hours of time, but is entitled to use the time he or she has already accrued. Under these circumstances, it would not be "reasonable under the circumstances" for the employer to require the employee to use a minimum of four hours of safe time or sick time as the minimum increment.

   (ii) Example: An employee is scheduled to work from 8:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M. Mondays. She schedules a doctor's appointment for 9:00 A.M. on a Monday and notifies her employer of her intent to use sick time and return to work the same day. The employer's written sick time policies require a four hour minimum increment of sick time used per day. If she does not go to work before her appointment, she should appear for work by 12:00 P.M.

(b) An employer may set fixed periods of thirty minutes or any smaller amount of time for the use of accrued safe time or sick time beyond the minimum increment described in subdivision (a) of this section and may require fixed start times for such intervals.

   Example: The employee in Example (ii) of subdivision (a) of this section arrives to work at 12:17 P.M. Under her employer's written sick time policies, employees must use sick time in half-hour intervals that start on the hour or half-hour. The employer can require the employee to use four-and-a-half hours of her accrued sick time and require her to begin work at 12:30 P.M. Similarly, if the employee wanted to leave work at 8:40 A.M. to go to her 9:00 A.M. doctor's appointment, the employer could require the employee to stop work at 8:30 A.M.








*§ 7-205 Employee Notification of Use of Safe Time or Sick Time.*


(a) An employer may require an employee to provide reasonable notice of the need to use safe time or sick time.

(b) An employer that requires notice of the need to use safe time or sick time where the need is not foreseeable shall provide a written policy that contains procedures for the employee to provide notice as soon as practicable. Examples of such procedures may include, but are not limited to, instructing the employee to: (1) call a designated phone number at which an employee can leave a message; (2) follow a uniform call-in procedure; or (3) use another reasonable and accessible means of communication identified by the employer. Such procedures for employees to give notice of the need to use safe time or sick time when the need is not foreseeable may not include any requirement that an employee appear in person at a worksite or deliver any document to the employer prior to using safe time or sick time.

(c) In determining when notice is practicable in a given situation, an employer must consider the individual facts and circumstances of the situation.

(d) An employer that requires notice of the need to use safe time or sick time where the need is foreseeable shall have a written policy for the employee to provide reasonable notice. Such policy shall not require more than seven days’ notice prior to the date such safe time or sick time is to begin. The employer may require that such notice be in writing.








*§ 7-206 Documentation from Licensed Health Care Provider.*


(a) When an employee’s use of sick time results in an absence of more than three consecutive work days, an employer may require reasonable written documentation that the use of sick time was for a purpose authorized under Section 20-914(a) of the Administrative Code. Written documentation signed by a licensed health care provider indicating the need for the amount of sick time taken shall be considered reasonable documentation. “Work days” as used in this subdivision and in Section 20-914(a)(2) of the Administrative Code means the days or parts of days the employee would have worked had the employee not used sick time.

(b) If an employer requires an employee to provide written documentation from a licensed health care provider when the employee’s use of sick time resulted in an absence of more than three consecutive work days, the employee shall be allowed a minimum of seven days from the date he or she returns to work to obtain such documentation. The employee is responsible for the cost of such documentation not covered by insurance or any other benefit plan.

(c) If an employee provides written documentation from a licensed health care provider in accordance with subdivision (a) of this section, an employer may not require an employee to obtain documentation from a second licensed health care provider indicating the need for sick time in the amount used by the employee.








*§ 7-207 Domestic Workers.*


(a) Domestic workers who have worked for the same employer for at least one year and who work more than 80 hours in a calendar year will be entitled to two days of paid safe/sick time per year, as provided in this section.

(b) The two days of paid safe/sick time must be calculated in the manner that paid days of rest for domestic workers are calculated, pursuant to New York State Labor Law Section 161(1).

(c) A domestic worker described in subdivision (a) of this section is entitled to two days of paid safe/sick time on the next date that such domestic worker is entitled to a paid day or days of rest under New York State Labor Law Section 161(1), and annually thereafter.

(d) Safe time and sick time accrued by a domestic worker will carry over to the next calendar year.








*§ 7-208 Rate of Pay for Safe Time and Sick Time.*


(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b) of this section, when using paid safe/sick time, an employee shall be compensated at the same hourly rate that the employee would have earned at the time the paid safe/sick time is taken.

(b) If the employee uses paid safe/sick time during hours that would have been designated as overtime, the employer is not required to pay the overtime rate of pay.

(c) An employee is not entitled to compensation for lost tips or gratuities, provided, however, that an employer must pay an employee whose hourly rate of pay or salary is based in whole or in part on tips or gratuities at least the full minimum wage.

(d) For employees who are paid on a commission (whether base wage plus commission or commission only), the hourly rate of pay shall be the base wage or minimum wage, whichever is greater.

(e) When an employer pays a flat rate of pay for work performed, regardless of the number of hours actually worked, an employee's hourly rate of pay shall be based on the most recent hourly rate paid to the employee for the applicable pay period, calculated by adding together the employee's total earnings, including tips, commissions, and supplements, for the most recent work week in which no safe time or sick time or other leave was taken and dividing that sum by the number of hours spent performing work during such work week or forty hours, whichever amount of hours is less.

(f) If an employee performs more than one job for the same employer or the employee's rate of pay fluctuates for a single job, the rate of pay shall be the rate of pay that the employee would have been paid during the time the employee used the safe time or sick time.

(g) An employer is not required to pay cash in lieu of supplements for safe time or sick time used if remuneration for employment includes supplements. The fact that an employer pays cash in lieu of supplements to an employee does not relieve the employer of the requirements of the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act.

(h) Under no circumstance can the employer pay the employee less than the minimum wage for paid safe/sick time.








*§ 7-209 Payment of Safe/Sick Time.*


(a) Safe time and sick time must be paid no later than the payday for the next regular payroll period beginning after the safe time or sick time was used by the employee.

(b) If the employer has asked for written documentation or verification of use of safe time or sick time, pursuant to Section 20-914(a), 20-914(b) or 20-914(d) of the Administrative Code, the employer is not required to pay safe time or sick time until the employee has provided such documentation or verification.








*§ 7-210 Employer's Sale of Business.*


(a) If an employer sells its business or the business is otherwise acquired by another business, an employee will retain and may use all accrued safe time and sick time if the employee continues to perform work within the City of New York for the successor employer.

(b) If the successor employer has fewer than five employees, and the former employer had more than five employees, the employee is entitled to use and be compensated for unused safe time and sick time accrued while working for the former employer, until such safe time and sick time is exhausted.

(c) A successor employer must provide employees with its written safe time and sick time policies at the time of sale or acquisition, or as soon as practicable thereafter, which shall include a policy that complies with this section.








*§ 7-211 Employer’s Written Safe Time and Sick Time Policies.*


(a) Every employer shall maintain written safe time and sick time policies in a single writing and follow such written safe time and sick time policies except as allowed in subdivision (d) of this section.

(b) Every employer must distribute its written safe time and sick time policies personally upon commencement of employment, within 14 days of the effective date of any changes to the policy, and upon request by the employee.

(c) An employer's written safe time and sick time policies must meet or exceed all of the requirements of the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act and this chapter and state at a minimum:

   (1) The employer's method of calculating safe time and sick time as follows:

      (i) If an employer provides employees with an amount of safe time and sick time that meets or exceeds the requirements of the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act on or before the employee's 120th day of employment and on the first day of each new calendar year, which for the purposes of this section is defined as "frontloaded safe time and sick time," then the employer's written safe time and sick time policy must specify the amount of frontloaded safe time and sick time to be provided;

      (ii) If the employer does not apply frontloaded safe time and sick time, then the employer's written safe time and sick time policy must specify when accrual of safe time and sick time starts, the rate at which an employee accrues safe time and sick time and the maximum number of hours an employee may accrue in a calendar year;

   (2) The employer's policies regarding the use of safe time and sick time, including any limitations or conditions the employer places on the use of safe time and sick time, such as:

      (i) Any requirement that an employee provide notice of a need to use safe time and sick time and the procedures for doing so in accordance with 6 RCNY § 7-205;

      (ii) Any requirement for written documentation or verification of the use of safe time and sick time in accordance with Sections 20-914(a)(2), 20-914(b)(2), or 20-914(d) of the Administrative Code, and the employer's policy regarding any consequences of an employee's failure or delay in providing such documentation or verification;

      (iii) Any reasonable minimum increment or fixed period for the use of accrued safe time and sick time;

      (iv) Any policy on discipline for employee misuse of safe time and sick time under 6 RCNC § 7-215; and

      (v) A description of the confidentiality requirements of Section 20-921 of the Administrative Code.

   (3) The employer's policy regarding carry-over of unused safe time and sick time at the end of an employer's calendar year in accordance with Section 20-913(h) of the Administrative Code; and,

   (4) If an employer uses a term other than "safe/sick time" or "safe and sick time" to describe leave provided by the employer to meet the requirements of the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act, the employer's policy must state that such leave may be used by an employee for any of the purposes set forth in the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act without any condition prohibited by the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act. Terms used to describe such leave may include, but are not necessarily limited to, "paid time off" ("PTO"), vacation time, personal days, or days of rest.

(d) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent an employer from making exceptions to its written safe time and sick time policy for individual employees that are more generous to the employee than the terms of the employer's written policy.

(e) Requirements relating to an employer's additional and separate obligation to provide employees with a Notice of Rights under the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act are set forth in Section 20-919 of the Administrative Code. An employer may not distribute the Notice of Rights required by Section 20-919 of the Administrative Code or any other department writing in lieu of distributing or posting its own written safe time and sick time policies as required by this section.

(f) An employer that has not provided to the employee a copy of its written safe time and sick time policies along with any forms or procedures required by the employer related to the use of safe time and sick time shall not deny safe time or sick time or payment of safe time or sick time to the employee based on non-compliance with such a policy.








*§ 7-212 Employer Records.*


(a) Employers must retain records demonstrating compliance with the requirements of the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act, including records of any policies required, pursuant to this Chapter, for a period of three years unless otherwise required by any other law, rule or regulation.

(b) An employer must maintain, in an accessible format, contemporaneous, true, and accurate records that show, for each employee:

   (1) The employee's name, address, phone number, date(s) of start of employment, date(s) of end of employment (if any), rate of pay, and whether the employee is exempt from the overtime requirements of New York State labor laws and regulations;

   (2) The hours worked each week by the employee, unless the employee is exempt from the overtime requirements of New York State labor laws and regulations and has a regular work week of forty hours or more;

   (4) Any change in the material terms of employment specific to the employee; and

   (5) The date that the Notice of Rights as set forth in Section 20-919 of the Administrative Code was provided to the employee and proof that the Notice of Rights was received by the employee.

(c) If the office issues a written request for information or records, an employer shall provide the office with such information or records, upon appropriate notice, at the department's office. Alternately, an employer shall provide the office with access to such information or records upon appropriate notice and at a mutually agreeable time of day at the employer's place of business.

(d) "Appropriate notice" shall mean 30 days' written notice, unless the employer agrees to a lesser amount of time, the office's request for the information or records is a second or subsequent request made to the same employer during the same investigation or case as the first request, or the office has reason to believe that:

   (1) the employer will destroy or falsify records;

   (2) the employer is closing, selling or transferring its business, disposing of assets or is about to declare bankruptcy;

   (3) the employer is the subject of a government investigation or enforcement action or proceeding related to wages and hours, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, discrimination, or an OLPS law or rule; or

   (4) more immediate access to records is necessary to prevent retaliation against employees.

(e) The office will make two attempts by letter, email or telephone to arrange a mutually agreeable time of day for the employer to provide access to its records in accordance with subdivision (d) of this section. If these attempts are not successful, the office may set a time to access records at the employer's place of business during regular business hours, upon two days' notice.








*§ 7-213 Enforcement and Penalties.*


(a) A finding that an employer has an official or unofficial policy or practice of not providing or refusing to allow the use of safe time or sick time as required under the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act constitutes a violation of Section 20-913 of the Administrative Code for each and every employee affected by the policy and will be subject to penalties as provided in Section 20-924(e) of the Code.

(b) For purposes of Section 20-924(e) of the Administrative Code, penalties shall be imposed on a per employee basis.

(c) If an employer, as a matter of policy or practice, does not allow accrual of safe time and sick time as required under the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act, the relief granted to each and every employee affected by the policy or practice must include either application of 40 hours of safe time and sick time to the employee's safe time and sick time balance or, where such information is known, application of the number of hours of safe time and sick time the employee should have accrued to the employee's safe time and sick time balance, provided that such balance does not exceed 80 hours.








*§ 7-214 Accrual, Hours Worked and Carry Over.*


(a) If an employee is scheduled and available to work for an on-call shift and is compensated for the scheduled time regardless of whether the employee works, the scheduled time constitutes hours worked for the purposes of accrual under the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act.

(b) For employees who are paid on a piecework basis, accrual of safe time and sick time is measured by the actual length of time spent performing work.

(c) For employees who are paid on a commission basis, accrual of safe time and sick time is measured by the actual length of time spent performing work.

(d) For employees with indeterminate shift lengths (e.g. a shift defined by business needs), an employer shall base the hours of safe time or sick time used upon the hours worked by the replacement employee for the same shift. If this method is not possible, the hours of safe time or sick time must be based on the hours worked by the employee when the employee most recently worked the same shift in the past.

(e) If an employee is rehired within six months of separation from employment and had not reached the required 120 days to begin using accrued safe time and sick time under Section 20-913(d)(1) of the Administrative Code at the time the employee separated from employment, upon resumption of employment, the employee shall be credited at least his or her previous calendar days towards the 120 day waiting period. For the purposes of this subdivision, "waiting period" shall mean the time period described in Section 20-913(d)(1) of the Administrative Code between the start of employment and the 120th calendar day following the start of employment or July 30, 2014, whichever is later, except for that an employer is not required to allow an employee to begin to use safe time before May 5, 2018.

(f) An employee may carry over up to 40 hours of unused safe and sick time from one calendar year to the next, unless the employer has a policy of paying employees for unused safe time and sick time at the end of the calendar year in which such time is accrued and providing the employee with an amount of paid safe time and sick time that meets or exceeds the requirements of the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act for such employee for the immediately subsequent calendar year on the first day of such year in accordance with Section 20-913(h) of the Administrative Code. Regardless of the number of hours an employee carried over from the previous calendar year, an employer is only required to allow employees to accrue up to 40 hours of safe time and sick time in a calendar year. If an employee's safe time and sick time balance exceeds 40 hours in a single calendar year, an employer is only required to allow the employee to use up to 40 hours in such calendar year.

   Example: An employee accrues 40 hours of safe time and sick time in calendar year one and uses 20 hours of safe time and sick time in calendar year one. She carries over 20 hours from calendar year one to calendar year two, accrues 40 hours in calendar year two, and does not use any hours in calendar year two. Her safe time and sick leave balance at the end of calendar year two is 60 hours (20 hours from calendar year two plus 40 hours from calendar year two). She may carry over 40 of those 60 hours into calendar year three and accrue another 40 hours in calendar year three.








*§ 7-215 Employee Abuse of Safe Time and Sick Time.*


An employer may take disciplinary action, up to and including termination, against an employee who uses safe time or sick time provided under the Earned Safe and Sick Time Act for purposes other than those described in Sections 20-914(a) and Section 20-914(b) of the Administrative Code. Indications of abuse of safe time and sick time may include, but are not limited to a pattern of: (1) use of unscheduled safe time and sick time on or adjacent to weekends, regularly scheduled days off, holidays, vacation or pay day, (2) taking scheduled safe time and sick time on days when other leave has been denied, and (3) taking safe time and sick time on days when the employee is scheduled to work a shift or perform duties perceived as undesirable.

(c) Each occurrence of a long-term or indefinite change for which a fast food employer fails to provide an updated good faith estimate before such employee receives the first work schedule following the change constitutes a violation of Section 20-1221(a) of the Fair Workweek Law.

(a) On or before a fast food employee’s first day of work, a fast food employer must provide such fast food employee with written notice of an initial work schedule containing all regular shifts and all on-call shifts the fast food employee will work until the start of the first shift of the next subsequent work schedule. The fast food employer must also issue an updated work schedule as required in paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 20-1221* of the Fair Workweek Law.

*§ 7-606 Employee consent and minimal changes to shifts*


(a) Where a fast food employee’s written consent is required to work additional hours, pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 20-1221 of the Fair Workweek Law or where a retail employee’s written consent is required to work an additional shift with less than 72 hours’ notice, pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 20-1251 of the Fair Workweek Law, such written consent must be provided in reference to a specific schedule change; general or ongoing consent is insufficient to meet such requirements.

(b) A fast food employer may change a previously scheduled regular shift by 15 minutes or less without being obligated to pay the fast food employee a schedule change premium. A fast food employer will be obligated to pay the fast food employee a schedule change premium if total changes made to one shift exceed 15 minutes.

Example: A fast food employer provides a fast food employee with a schedule that includes a shift on Tuesday from 12:00 P.M. to 5:00 P.M. At approximately 5:00 P.M. on Tuesday, the fast food employer asks the fast food employee to work a few minutes more to assist with a large tour group that just came to the fast food establishment. She agrees in writing and finishes the work at 5:12 P.M. The fast food employer need not pay her the schedule change premium.








*§ 7-607 Notice and offer of additional shifts*


(a) A fast food employer must notify a fast food employee in writing of the method by which additional shifts will be posted in accordance with Section 20-1241 of the Fair Workweek Law upon commencement of a fast food employee’s employment with the fast food employer and within 24 hours of any change to or adoption of a method.

(b) The fast food employer must post notice of additional shifts for three consecutive calendar days. When a fast food employer has less than three days’ notice of a need to fill an additional shift, the fast food employer shall post notice of the additional shift for three consecutive calendar days as soon as practicable and not more than 24 hours after finding out about the need to fill the shift. Where there is less than three days’ notice, any existing fast food employee may be offered, on a temporary basis, additional shifts that take place prior to the conclusion of the three-day notice period.

Example: On Wednesday at 9:00 A.M., a fast food employer receives a call from a fast food employee who tells her that she is quitting and she will not report for her regularly scheduled shift on Friday at 9:00 A.M. The fast food employer knew of the need to fill the shift 48 hours (or two days) in advance. The fast food employer may offer another existing fast food employee the shift on the first Friday, but must post the available shift with three days’ notice to its employees and assign subsequent Friday 9:00 A.M. shifts to its existing fast food employees in accordance with its criteria in accordance with Section 20-1241 of the Fair Workweek Law and this subchapter before hiring a new employee.

(c) A fast food employer that owns 50 or more fast food establishments in New York City may offer additional shifts, in accordance with subdivisions (a), (b), (f) and (g) of Section 20-1241 of the Fair Workweek Law and in compliance with subdivision (b) of this section, to: (1) fast food employees who work at all locations in New York City, or (2) only to its fast food employees who work at its fast food establishments located in the same borough as the location where the shifts will be worked.

(d) As soon as possible after a fast food employer has filled an additional shift, and using the same method compliant with Section 20-1241 of the Fair Workweek Law by which the fast food employer communicated the offer of additional shifts, the fast food employer must notify all accepting fast food employees when the offered shift has been filled.








*§ 7-608 Accepting and awarding additional shifts*


(a) A fast food employee may accept a subset of additional shifts offered by a fast food employer, pursuant to Section 20-1241 of the Fair Workweek Law.

(b) A fast food employer must first award shifts or shift increments to current fast food employees at the location where the shifts will be worked, regardless of the employer’s other criteria prescribed, pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 20-1241 of the Fair Workweek Law.

(c) A fast food employee may accept an entire shift offered by a fast food employer or any shift increment. A fast food employer is not required to award a fast food employee a shift increment accepted by the fast food employee when the remaining portion of the shift is three hours or less and was not accepted by another fast food employee or other fast food employees.

Example: A fast food employer notified employees of an additional shift on Saturdays from 1:00 P.M. to 9:00 P.M., an eight-hour shift. A fast food employee informs the employer that she can work from 3:00 P.M. to 9:00 P.M., a six-hour shift increment. Two hours remain in the additional shift and no other employee accepted the remaining two hours. Therefore, the employer need not award the six-hour increment to the employee.

(d) When a fast food employee accepts a shift that was offered by a fast food employer, pursuant to Section 20-1241 of the Fair Workweek Law that overlaps with the fast food employee’s existing shift, before hiring a new fast food employee for the offered shift, the fast food employer must award the fast food employee the offered shift in lieu of the fast food employee’s scheduled shift. The fast food employer may not condition the award of the offered shift on a fast food employee’s willingness to work both the non-overlapping hours of the existing shift and the offered shift.

Example: A fast food employee’s work schedule includes a shift on Mondays from 7 am to 3 pm. The fast food employer notifies employees of an additional shift on Mondays from 9:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M., a shift that overlaps with the fast food employee’s existing shift. The fast food employee accepts the shift because it will allow the employee to drop the employee’s child off at school in the morning without reducing the employee’s overall hours. The fast food employer must award the additional shift to the fast food employee before hiring a new fast food employee for the additional shift, provided the fast food employee otherwise meets the employer’s criteria for distribution of the shift.

(e) When a fast food employee accepts a shift that was offered by a fast food employer, pursuant to Section 20-1241 of the Fair Workweek Law that, if awarded to and worked by the fast food employee, would entitle the fast food employee to overtime pay, the fast food employer is not required to award the fast food employee the entire shift but, before hiring a new fast food employee for the entire offered shift, must award the fast food employee the largest shift increment possible that would not trigger overtime pay, provided that the remaining portion of the shift was accepted by another fast food employee or is three hours or more.

Example: A fast food employer offers a shift on Wednesday from 12:00 A.M. to 6:00 A.M. to its employees. A fast food employee who is scheduled to work 37 hours during the week accepts the additional shift. The employer must award at least three hours to the fast food employee but is not required to award the entire six-hour shift to the employee because working more than forty hours would result in the employee becoming eligible for overtime pay.








*§ 7-609 Employer records*


(a) Fast food and retail employers must maintain and retain, in an electronically accessible format, contemporaneous, true, and accurate records documenting compliance with the requirements of the Fair Workweek Law for a period of three years.

   1. Such records shall include documents that show:

      ii. An employee’s written consent to any schedule changes, where required; and

(b) Upon request, a fast food or retail employer must provide a fast food or retail employee with such employee’s work schedule for any previous week worked for the past three years within 14 days of the employee’s request.

(c) Upon request, a fast food or retail employer must provide a fast food or retail employee with the most current version of the complete work schedule for all employees who work at the same location within one week of the employee’s request, provided that an employer not disclose the work schedule of any employee who has been granted an accommodation based on the employee’s status as a survivor of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault, where such disclosure would conflict with such accommodation.








*§ 7-610 Private right of action*


(a) A person who filed a complaint with the office, pursuant to the Fair Workweek Law and who intends to withdraw the complaint to pursue a civil action shall withdraw the complaint in writing to the office prior to commencing a civil action that includes claims based on the Fair Workweek Law in accordance with paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 20-1211 of the Fair Workweek Law.

(b) A person who filed a civil action that includes any claims based on the Fair Workweek Law may file a complaint with the office upon a showing that the Fair Workweek Law claims in the civil action have been withdrawn or dismissed without prejudice to further action.

(c) The withdrawal of a complaint filed with the office or the commencement of a civil action by a person does not preclude the office from investigating the fast food or retail employer, or commencing, prosecuting, or settling a case against the employer based on some or all of the same violations.








*§ 7-611 Waiver of rights*


Any agreement by an employee with the intent to prospectively waive or limit the employee’s rights, pursuant to the Fair Workweek Law shall be invalid as a matter of law.
